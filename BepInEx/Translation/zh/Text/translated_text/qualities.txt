The Ringmaster stands and shakes your hand as you enter. He is rather short, now he isn't standing on top of a calliope.

I've a special pair to make me look tall.\ He laughs and bids you sit to enjoy a pot of tea with him.=环形使者 在你进来时站起来和你握手。他相当矮小，现在他没有站在卡里乌斯的顶部。他向你挥舞着他的手指。\他严厉地说：我在这一行干得够久了，知道你在想什么。\It's the shoes! 我有一双特别的鞋，让我看起来很高。他笑了笑，请你坐下来和他一起享受一壶茶。
The Ringmaster waves you in as you poke your head through the tent flap. He offers you a seat, a spot of coffee, and knowledge of your future. \n\n\My cards know it all,\ he says, tapping the pack poking out of his breast pocket. He shuffles, and bids you cut; then, he turns over a few from the top, and make vague proclamations about future successes.=当你把头探进帐篷的挡板时，团长向你招手。他给你提供了一个座位，一杯咖啡，以及关于你未来的知识。\他说：我的牌知道这一切，他敲打着从胸前口袋里探出的牌包。他洗牌，并让你切牌；然后，他从上面翻出几张，并对未来的成功做了模糊的宣告。
The Ringmaster pores over a few cards arranged in a cross. You politely cough before he notices you. He turns crimson and apologises. \n\n\Forgive me, I was divining. No, no, not for a lark. Now and then I'll amuse visitors with it, but when it comes to matters of our Circus, it's rather different. But don't worry about that. Could I challenge you to a game of Rummy?\ =圈主仔细研究了几张交叉排列的牌。在他注意到你之前，你礼貌地咳嗽了一声。他脸色发红，并表示歉意。\请原谅我，我在占卜。不，不，不是为了好玩。现在，我会用它来取悦游客，但当它涉及到我们马戏团的事情时，它是相当不同的。不过不用担心这个问题。我可以向你挑战，玩一局拉米牌吗？
The Ringmaster closes the volume he was reading as you enter. He smiles congenially. \I'm studying the Reach's history. I can't help but feel Plenty and I should have researched our rock better before settling.\ \n\nHim and Plenty? Is he Polmear? The Ringmaster smiles proudly, but says nothing.=当你进来时，马戏团团长合上了他正在阅读的书。他友好地笑了笑。\我正在研究Reach的历史。我不禁觉得，在定居之前，丰盛和我应该更好地研究我们的岩石。\他和丰盛？他是Polmear吗？圈主得意地笑了笑，但什么也没说。
The Ringmaster leans back in his chair, sifting through his cards with a frown. He only nods when you request a seat. \n\n\You know...\ He flips a few cards onto the table, before snatching them up, shuffling, and flipping the same few again. \We can't leave. We just can't do it. The cards say so.\ \n\nHe tosses the deck onto his desk; they spill across the wood, all black and red. \I wish it were otherwise. But the show must go on..\=圈主靠在椅子上，皱着眉头筛查他的卡片。当你要求坐下时，他只是点点头。\你知道...。他把几张牌翻到桌子上，然后把它们抓起来，洗牌，又把同样的几张牌翻了一遍。\我们不能离开。我们就是不能这样做。牌上是这么说的。\他把牌扔到他的桌子上；它们在木头上散开，全是黑色和红色。\I wish it were otherwise. 但表演必须继续下去。

Back here, they clink glasses in celebration and devise new wonders for the future guests who will come.=擂台管理员的卡里奥普吹响了它嘈杂的曲调，但即使是它，在前面客人的吼叫声中也几乎听不见。表演者们正在轮流进行免费表演，让游客们大呼过瘾。回到这里，他们碰杯庆祝，并为将来要来的客人设计新的奇迹。
Beyond the performers and the permanent audience, the Circus is deserted. Everyone keeps to their quarters, unless they're practising the show. Despite the calliope music, the mood back here is closer to that of a mausoleum.=除了表演者和常驻观众之外，马戏团已经荒废了。每个人都躲在自己的房间里，除非他们在练习表演。尽管有卡里欧音乐，但这里的气氛更接近于陵墓。

Dilly has been up to her tricks again.=两个司炉工解释说，他们在一个人指责另一个人偷了他的结婚戒指后几乎发生了冲突，毕竟被指控的一方当时正戴着它！。后来他们才意识到，戒指是戴在正确的手指上，但他们的手指被调换了。迪莉又开始耍花招了。
This time, Dilly is roughly bundled under somebody's arm. A crewman removes a glove and thrusts his hand toward you.

We were never in any doubt as to the ability of the brave Tackety troops to quell the riots and retain control over the capital.

A surprise declaration at Victory Hall this morning, sanctioning routine inspections of all mercantile ships coming into New Winchester, \in the interests of fairness.\ The Windward Company has cried foul, arguing that the line between merchant and fighter vessels is too loosely defined for Tackety engines, and the measure is merely a pretext to search Company ships alone.\n=今天上午在胜利厅发表了一份意外的声明，批准对所有进入新温彻斯特的商船进行例行检查，为了公平起见。 向风公司大喊大叫，认为商船和战舰之间的界限对于Tackety引擎来说定义太松散了，这项措施只是一个单独搜查公司船只的借口。
Lustrum has been turned upside down this week. A raid on a prominent counting house has turned up evidence of collusion and collaboration with known criminal elements.

An old face has returned to frontline Reach politics. Sweet Jane has had her name cleared at a heated meeting of the Assembly, which ran well into the small hours of the morning. Despite fierce opposition from the Indurate Veteran, the Assembly ruled Sweet Jane innocent of wilful malice in the actions leading to the destruction of the Queensbridge during the Blockade, and thirteen of the other fifteen charges made against her dating from that period. The Governor of New Winchester, in exile in London, has declined to comment, though the family of her wife has expressed their opposition to the ruling.=一张老面孔已经回到了前线的Reach政治。甜蜜的简在一次激烈的议会会议上洗刷了自己的罪名，这次会议一直持续到凌晨。尽管有退伍军人的激烈反对，议会仍裁定斯威特-简在封锁期间导致皇后桥号被毁的行动中没有故意的恶意，而对她提出的其他15项指控中的13项也是在那个时期提出的。流亡在伦敦的新温彻斯特州长拒绝发表评论，尽管她妻子的家人表示反对这一裁决。
Stocks have risen in the Windward Company, following the restoration of the Parsimonious Chairman to Head of the Committee for Peacetime Liaisons, following a brief absence after what a spokesman referred to as 'a lapse'.

A midnight skirmish in the outer region has been reported. A Windward Company engine destroyed on its way back from Traitor's Wood. Two Tackety captains have been hauled into Victory Hall for questioning, though a spokesperson for the Assembly has stated that a sudden loss of visibility is to blame. \After all, in the dark, who can tell the difference between a London engine and a Windward one?\=据报道，在外围地区发生了一场午夜小规模冲突。一台Windward公司的发动机在从Traitor's Wood回来的路上被摧毁。两名Tackety船长被拖到胜利厅接受审问，尽管大会的发言人表示是由于突然失去能见度造成的。\After all, in the dark, who can tell the difference between a London engine and a Windward one?
Reports of a devastating battle above Titania are being reported. Several senior members of the Assembly have resigned, while the Windward Company is demanding the resignation of the Rhapsodic Mayor. The Gazette believes a planned raid by the Windward Company on a den of Tackety smugglers was almost thrown off course by the sudden intervention of a swarm of Chorister Bees. Most of the Company engines have been seen returning to Port Prosper. The Tacketies have vanished, or else perished altogether. =据报道，泰坦尼亚上空发生了一场毁灭性的战斗。议会的几个高级成员已经辞职，而Windward公司则要求狂想曲市长辞职。公报认为，向风公司计划对Tackety走私者的窝点进行突袭，但由于一群Chorister蜜蜂的突然介入，几乎被打乱了方向。人们看到公司的大部分发动机已经返回普罗斯珀港。Tacketies已经消失了，或者是完全消亡了。
A secret munitions factory in the lower district has been shelled! Acting on hidden intelligence, the Indurate Veteran convened an emergency session of the Assembly, authorising lethal force to be used in removing the threat. No survivors are reported, and no casualties amongst the Assembly's men. The Windward Company has offered all the help it can in the ongoing investigation.=下层地区的一个秘密军火厂被炮击了！。根据隐藏的情报，印度老兵召开了一次紧急会议，授权使用致命的武力来消除威胁。据报道，没有幸存者，议会的人员也没有伤亡。向风公司已经为正在进行的调查提供了所有的帮助。
With the sweeping and unexpected victory of the Windward Company during the Second Battle of New Winchester, the New Gazette would like to take this moment to offer our sincerest congratulations to the new masters of the port. We would also like to request that the Company take into account the unique history and character of New Winchester, as they press on with their reforms, and remember that we are not Port Prosper nor would we wish to be. We also hope that the Windward Company retire their Committee for Peacetime Liaisons forthwith. =随着向风公司在第二次新温彻斯特战役中取得了出乎意料的全面胜利，《新公报》想借此机会向港口的新主人表示最真诚的祝贺。我们还想要求公司在推进改革时，考虑到新温彻斯特的独特历史和特点，并记住我们不是普罗斯福港，也不希望成为普罗斯福港。我们还希望向风公司立即撤销其和平时期联络委员会。
Despite the victory, rumours are circulating throughout New Winchester's stations that the Company is building new engines in Port Prosper's workyards. Dreadnoughts have been spotted on the Isambard Line. It seems London will not abandon its proxy lightly. =尽管取得了胜利，但整个新温彻斯特的车站都在流传谣言，说公司正在普罗斯珀港的工场里建造新的引擎。在伊桑巴德线上已经发现了无畏舰。看来伦敦不会轻易放弃其代理人。
Despite recent setbacks, the Assembly has had an extremely good week. New legislation introducing Independent Licenses to prospectors in Lustrum have proved very popular, while the new Rule from Home, Help from Afar Bill has been applauded by representatives from Port Avon, Titania, and even the Acting Government of Port Prosper. Meanwhile, Sweet Jane's raids on presumed abandoned Company outposts have borne fruit.=尽管最近遇到了一些挫折，但议会本周的表现非常好。事实证明，为拉斯特鲁姆的勘探者引入独立许可证的新立法非常受欢迎，而新的 来自国内的统治，来自国外的帮助 法案得到了来自艾文港、泰坦尼亚，甚至是普洛斯珀港代理政府的代表们的赞扬。同时，斯威特-简对假定被遗弃的公司前哨的突击检查已经取得了成果。
The Windward Company continue to press their advantage, seemingly in response to the Assembly's perceived complacency. The Acting Government on Port Prosper suffered a coup late Monday evening, when the Cabinet was arrested at the Admiral Nelson, the temporary headquarters of the Government. The Windward Company has regained control of the civilian government, and is encouraging other ports to fight back against the \Tackety Tyranny.\ =向风公司继续压榨他们的优势，似乎是对议会认为的自满的回应。普罗斯珀港的代理政府在周一晚间遭遇政变，内阁在政府的临时总部纳尔逊海军上将号被逮捕。向风公司已经重新获得了对文职政府的控制权，并鼓励其他港口对 Tackety Tyranny 进行反击。
In a dramatic sequence of events shocking to all those who haven't been following the pages of the New Gazette, the Assembly late last night voted to withdraw from the governments of many ports in the Reach, and to allow the Windward Company to return to New Winchester. The increasingly unpopular Assembly has had to contend with growing discontent over reduced supplies  spread even more thinly  and the limitations of their own abilities. Do we detect the Prudent Secretary's hand in the new accord?=在一连串戏剧性的事件中，所有没有关注《新公报》版面的人都感到震惊，议会在昨天深夜投票决定退出Reach地区许多港口的政府，并允许Windward公司返回New Winchester。越来越不受欢迎的议会不得不应对因供应减少而分布得更加稀疏以及自身能力有限而产生的日益不满。我们是否发现慎重的秘书在新协议中的作用？
Despite this seeming victory, the Windward Company's hold is less secure than it seemed. The New Gazette can confirm the survival of several key figures in the Assembly, including the Indurate Veteran and Sweet Jane, both of whom have been sighted on Lustrum. Already there are murmurs of discontent in the far flung ports of the Reach, who will not take kindly to any attempts to impose Direct Rule upon them. \n=尽管这似乎是一场胜利，但Windward公司的控制并不像它看起来那么安全。新公报》可以证实议会中的几个关键人物还活着，包括Indurate Veteran和Sweet Jane，他们都在Lustrum被发现了。在远方的港口，已经有了不满的杂音，他们不会对任何将直接统治强加给他们的企图感到高兴。\n
We've received word from the Parsimonious Chairman that our doomsaying and bellyaching is becoming something of a headache. Meanwhile, we have also received a very nice note from the Prudent Secretary praising our recent work. Trade has improved to New Winchester, and the other ports are approaching the Board of Directors with offers to begin negotiations. So far, there seems little appetite for a resumption of hostilities from all but the most ardent of Tackety supporters.\n=我们收到了帕西蒙尼主席的消息，说我们的末日论和抱怨正在成为令人头痛的事情。同时，我们也收到了谨慎的秘书的一封很好的信，称赞我们最近的工作。对新温彻斯特的贸易已经有所改善，其他港口也在向董事会提出开始谈判。到目前为止，除了最热心的Tackety的支持者之外，似乎没有人愿意恢复敌对行动。
The strident efforts on the part of the Company to flush out collaborators and sympathisers appears to have had the opposite effect to what was intended. There are now areas of the port (we are told) that are no-go for Company officials, including the entire Bishopbridge region. Pardoned members of the Assembly gather in the Round Table. Contact has been cut by many of the outlying ports, most ominously Lustrum.\n=公司为赶走合作者和同情者所做的激烈努力似乎产生了与预期相反的效果。现在港口的一些地区（我们被告知）是公司官员的禁区，包括整个毕晓普桥地区。被赦免的议会成员聚集在圆桌会议上。许多外围港口已经切断了联系，最不祥的是Lustrum.n
We publish here, with only minor edits, a letter from the Prudent Secretary. \Following the recent period of turbulence, it has come to our attention that the Windward Company has been approaching the New Winchester situation incorrectly. We are not unsympathetic to the charges put against us: namely rigidity, inflexibility, conspiracy and espionage. We somewhat resent 'indiscriminate terror' however. It has been anything but. Nonetheless, it has become apparent we lack the public support to continue as we are without needlessly and injuriously imposing our program on the unwilling. As such, we have invited the Assembly to reconvene on New Winchester, with our full and fulsome support. I feel compelled to make clear that the Windward Company does not regard this as a defeat, but rather a new opportunity for peaceful cooperation and bipartisanship in the Reach.\\n=我们在此发表谨慎秘书的一封信，只做了少量编辑。\在最近一段时间的动荡之后，我们注意到，向风公司对新温彻斯特的情况的处理是不正确的。我们对针对我们的指控并非没有同情心：即僵化、不灵活、阴谋和间谍活动。但是，我们对 不分青红皂白的恐怖 有些反感。这不是什么好事。然而，我们显然缺乏公众的支持，无法继续我们的工作，也无法将我们的计划无谓地、有害地强加给不愿意的人。因此，我们已经邀请大会在新的温彻斯特重新召开会议，并得到我们充分和有力的支持。我觉得有必要明确指出，向风公司不认为这是一次失败，而是在达成和平合作和两党合作的新机会。
All work at Victory Hall has been stalled by a measure introduced by the Prudent Secretary of the Windward Company, attempting to regulate the materials of engines the Company will accept trade with and from. It is widely believed the measure is an attempt by the Company to force the Assembly to reveal their part in supporting the practice of illegal engine construction from salvage taken from wrecked locomotives.=胜利厅的所有工作都因向风公司的谨慎秘书提出的一项措施而停滞不前，该措施试图规范公司接受与之贸易的发动机材料。人们普遍认为，该措施是公司试图迫使大会揭露他们在支持用从失事机车上打捞的材料非法制造发动机的做法中的作用。
The Amenable Host at Magdalene's has reported an influx of traumatised and sky-mad Tackety crew. They all refer to an unprovoked attack off Port Avon, where the enemy guns were deliberately targeting the glass of their windows, thus disabling the engines and leaving the identity of the enemy entirely concealed. The Windward Company has pointed out that this would be in direct contravention of the Laws of Engagement established by the Assembly.=马格达林的可敬主人报告说，大量受到创伤和天性疯狂的Tackety船员涌入。他们都提到了阿文港附近的一次无端攻击，敌人的炮火故意瞄准他们的窗户玻璃，从而使发动机失灵，使敌人的身份完全被掩盖。向风公司指出，这将直接违反大会制定的交战法。
Fury in the Windward Company offices as a supposed company holiday ended in disaster. Discounted tickets to Polmear and Plenty's Circus transpired to coincide with a date when the Ring Leader's cards left them unable (or unwilling) to put on a performance. The offer to purchase new tickets at full price for the next day was not taken up, the Gazette understands.=在Windward公司的办公室里大发雷霆，因为一个所谓的公司假期以灾难告终。波尔梅尔和普兰蒂马戏团的折扣票恰好是一个日期，环形领袖的卡片使他们无法（或不愿意）进行表演。据《公报》了解，以全价购买第二天的新票的提议没有被采纳。
Tensions mount in the Gulf of Gloam, as the stalled Tackety Scout refuses any attempt at rescue by patrolling Windward Company engines. The captain has called in aid from a Tackety contingent on manoeuvres near Traitor's Wood, which the Windward Commander is unwilling to let approach. Bloodshed is expected imminently.=在Gloam海湾，由于停滞不前的Tackety Scout号拒绝了Windward公司发动机巡逻的任何救援尝试，局势变得紧张起来。舰长已经要求Tackety特遣队在 叛徒森林 附近进行演习，Windward指挥官不愿意让它接近。预计流血事件很快就会发生。

A Poetic Companion at Port Avon=埃文港的诗意伴侣
WriteAPoem=WriteAPoem
It is a limerick, ostensibly about the entire pursuit of skyfaring, but with allusions to your own voyage through the stars. Although it depicts both as absurd, the Poetic Forged Companion has such a light touch that the overall effect is cheering. Truly, there is something inspiring in humanity's propensity to fling itself into the unknown.=这是一首打油诗，表面上是关于整个追求天空飞行的过程，但却暗指自己在星空中的航行。虽然它把两者都描绘得很荒谬，但《诗意锻造的伙伴》有这样一种轻盈的感觉，整体效果令人欢欣鼓舞。诚然，在人类向未知世界投掷自己的倾向中，有一些令人鼓舞的东西。
TeachMe=TeachMe
\Do you know that the rate of scientific discovery is increasing exponentially?\ says the Studious Forged Companion. \By comparing evidence from texts written at different points within the last one thousand years, we can deduce the revelations that will be made ten, fifty, even a hundred years from now. Here\\n\nThe Companion rifles through a stack of papers and retrieves a page of diagrams drawn in its own neat hand. They explain them so systematically that you are easily able to understand the train of thought that lead to their extraordinary conclusions.=你知道科学发现的速度正以指数形式增长吗？《学习锻造的伙伴》说。\通过比较过去一千年内不同时间点的文字证据，我们可以推断出十年、五十年、甚至一百年后的启示。Here（这里）同伴从一叠文件中翻出一页用自己整齐的手画的图。他们如此系统地解释它们，以至于你很容易理解导致其非凡结论的思路。
FightMe=FightMe
The Pugilistic Forged Companion strides towards you, their paper stuffing rustling. Their first punch catches you in the jaw; the explosion of pain is exhilarating. Every retaliatory blow you land is absorbed by their elastic skin, but the awareness that you cannot injure them impels you to fight harder.\n\nPerhaps the Companion judges that you have relieved enough tension, because without warning it darts behind you, strikes your knees from behind and kicks you in the back just as your legs buckle. \n\nThe blood rushes in your ears as you clamber back to your feet, and you feel more alert than you have for days.=搏击锻造的同伴大步向你走来，他们的纸塞子沙沙作响。他们的第一拳打在你的下巴上；疼痛的爆发让人振奋。你的每一次报复性打击都被他们的弹性皮肤所吸收，但你不能伤害他们的意识促使你更努力地战斗。也许同伴判断你已经缓解了足够的紧张，因为在没有警告的情况下，它飞奔到你身后，从后面打击你的膝盖，并在你的腿弯曲时踢你的背部。\当你重新站起来的时候，血液在你的耳边涌动，你感到比几天前更警觉。
DoATrick=DoATrick
The Illusive Forged Companion cuts the deck. \Choose a card, but don't tell me what it is. Now, replace it in the pack. Shuffle. Now, put the cards here.\ It indicates a spot on the scuffed metal floor. \n\nYou do as you are told, and the Companion takes a box of matches from the table, strikes one, and lowers it to the deck, which bursts into flames. When there is nothing but ash, the Companion gestures to the porthole. For a moment, your card flutters against the other side of the glass, before drifting away into the Wilderness.=虚幻的锻造伙伴 切开了牌。\选择一张牌，但不要告诉我它是什么。现在，把它放到牌包里。洗牌。现在，把牌放在这里。 它指了指擦过的金属地板上的一个地方。\你照做了，同伴从桌子上拿了一盒火柴，点燃了一根，然后把它放到牌上，牌就烧起来了。当只有灰烬时，同伴向舷窗做了个手势。有那么一瞬间，你的牌在玻璃的另一边飘动，然后飘向了荒野。
IllusiveRoot=幻影之根
The Illusive Forged Companion is practicing card tricks in a mirror. =虚幻锻造的同伴正在镜子里练习牌技。

AGentleAwakening=温柔的觉醒（AGentleAwakening
It is a poem written in the epic style. Whilst it is lightly-written and seasoned with humour, the central figure  an intrepid skyfarer  is unambiguously heroic. Moreover, they bear unmistakable similarities to yourself!=这是一首以史诗风格写成的诗。虽然它写得很轻松，并带有幽默感，但中心人物--一个无畏的天空旅行者是毫不含糊的英雄主义。此外，他们与你自己有着明确无误的相似之处！
VolumePoetryRoot=VolumePoetryRoot
The Poetic Forged Companion gives you a volume of satirical verse. It is hilarious and incendiary, yet so deftly written that the Ministry of Public Decency could not object to a single word.=《诗意的锻造伴侣》给你一卷讽刺诗。它是搞笑的、煽情的，但写得如此巧妙，以至于公共道德部无法反对任何一个字。
Infamy=臭名昭著
Its subject is not named, but it bears many similarities to you. You did not realise you had so many flaws, or that your exploits were so comical.=它的主题没有命名，但它与你有许多相似之处。你没有意识到你有这么多缺点，也没有意识到你的经历是如此滑稽。
APoetryReading=APoetryReading
The crew jostle at the feet of the Poetic Forged Companion, who is reciting an incendiary polemic. Murmurs of dissent ripple through the gathering. More than once, you hear the word 'strike'.=船员们在诗意锻造的同伴脚下挤来挤去，他正在朗诵一篇煽动性的论述。不同意见的咕哝声在聚会中荡漾。你不止一次听到 罢工 这个词。

The intervention needs to be dramatic if it is to distract the crew from their plans.=如果要分散船员们的计划，干预需要具有戏剧性。
APoetryReadingResult1=APoetryReadingResult1
You conjure memories of the long hours your crew have spent toiling in the cold with you, the times you have saved their lives and they yours, and desperately urge them to listen to you, their captain, and return to their duties. One by one, they unclench their fists and turn their attention away from the Poetic Forged Companion. The revolutionary fire dimming from their eyes, they return to work.\n\nIt is troubling that such effort should be required to impel the crew to do their jobs. What is more, the same speech will not have an impact a second time.=你想起了你的船员在寒冷中和你一起度过的漫长时光，想起了你救了他们的命，他们也救了你的命，你拼命劝他们听你这个船长的话，回到他们的岗位上去。他们一个接一个地松开拳头，把注意力从诗意锻造的同伴身上移开。革命的火焰从他们的眼睛里黯淡下来，他们回到了工作岗位上。令人不安的是，需要这样的努力来促使船员完成他们的工作。更重要的是，同样的讲话不会有第二次的影响。
StorageRoot=StorageRoot
The Illusive Companion fashions you a costume from satin and velvet. Deft draping conceals padding that makes you appear more physically powerful than you are. A signaller sees you try it on, and is impressed. \Pardon me,\ they say, blushing, \but since you are so strong, do you think you could move my bunk into a more comfortable position? It is welded to the floor, but I am sure you could manage.\=虚幻的同伴用绸缎和天鹅绒为你设计了一套服装。巧妙的悬垂掩盖了填充物，使你看起来比你的身体更强大。一个信号员看到你试穿它，对你印象深刻。\他们红着脸说：请原谅，但既然你这么强壮，你能不能把我的床铺移到一个更舒适的位置？它被焊接在地板上，但我相信你可以做到。
AMagicShowRoot=AMagicShowRoot
The Illusive Forged Companion is entertaining the crew. At first, the tricks are delightful  a rabbit leaps from a hat, endless scarves spill from a sleeve  but gradually become more disturbing. A crew member volunteers to be sawn in half, but the illusion is so realistic that they are overcome with horror. The audience panic.=虚幻的锻造伴侣正在娱乐船员。起初，这些把戏很讨人喜欢，兔子从帽子里跳出来，无尽的围巾从袖子里洒出来，但逐渐变得更加令人不安。一名船员自愿被锯成两半，但幻觉是如此逼真，以至于他们被恐怖所征服。观众们惊慌失措。

Destroy=摧毁
You press the point of the blade against the taut skin of their chest. As soon as it tears through the thick membrane, balls of paper stuffing tumble out in rank clumps. The Companion watches as you reach inside their abdomen and pull out handfuls of mouldy paper, throwing them to the floor. \n\nEventually, all that remains is the Companion's damp, twitching skin, =你把刀尖压在他们胸前紧绷的皮肤上。当它撕开厚厚的薄膜时，纸馅的球就会成团地滚出来。同伴看着你把手伸进他们的腹部，拉出几把发霉的纸，把它们扔到地上。\最后，只剩下同伴潮湿的、抽搐的皮肤。

Perception2=感知2
The Illusive Companion erects a screen of mirrors around you, making it appear as though you are floating untethered through the Wilderness. \You see?\ says the Companion. \You are adrift in the void. Nothing can hurt you here.\ \n\nYou grasp the delicately-painted crockery tightly as to allow the vision to become more vivid. Whenever the vertigo of the illusory Wilderness threatens to overwhelm you, you focus your attention on the cool china beneath your fingertips.\n\nWhen the Companion removes the mirrors, you are less afraid, more able to face the challenges ahead. Unfortunately, you are also surrounded by broken crockery, and your hands are riddled with porcelain splinters.=虚幻的同伴在你周围竖起一道镜子的屏幕，使你看起来就像在荒野中无拘无束地漂浮。\You see? 同伴说。\你在虚空中漂流。这里没有什么可以伤害你。\你紧紧地抓住画得很精致的陶器，以便让视觉变得更加生动。每当虚幻的荒野的眩晕感威胁到你时，你就把注意力集中在指尖下的凉瓷上。不幸的是，你也被破碎的陶器所包围，你的手被瓷器的碎片弄得千疮百孔。
Perception3=感知3
The Illusive Companion erects a screen of mirrors around you, making it appear as though you are floating untethered through the Wilderness. \You see?\ says the Companion. \You are adrift in the void. Nothing can hurt you here.\ \n\nYour flight through the illusory Wilderness becomes more vivid, but you never feel afraid. On the contrary, the aimless drifting soothes your turbulent mind.\n\nAfter some time, you gradually return to your senses. It is as if you have been on a restorative holiday, and you feel calmer, more rested, and better equipped to face the challenges ahead. It is only when you realise that you have been in a trance for three days that your sense of well-being is tempered with annoyance.=虚幻的同伴在你周围竖起一道镜子的屏幕，使你看起来就像在荒野中无拘无束地漂浮。\You see? 同伴说。\你在虚空中漂流。这里没有什么可以伤害你。\你在虚幻的荒野中的飞行变得更加生动，但你从未感到害怕。相反，漫无目的的漂流使你动荡的心灵得到安抚。一段时间后，你逐渐恢复了理智。就像你已经度过了一个恢复性的假期，你感觉更平静，更有活力，更有能力去面对未来的挑战。只有当你意识到你已经恍惚了三天，你的幸福感才会被恼怒所抵消。

Excited murmurs die as you begin. It is a fine structure; every stanza is supported by its lines; every line crafted of carefully selected words; the words chosen for their cadence, down to the syllable. Is this not how Odysseus told his story to the Phaeacians? He must have spent his years dwelling over his account, too.=兴奋的杂音在你开始时就消失了。这是一个很好的结构；每一节都由它的句子支持；每一行都由精心挑选的词语组成；词语的选择是为了它们的节奏，直到音节。奥德修斯不就是这样向斐亚克人讲述他的故事的吗？他一定也花了很多年的时间在他的叙述上。

The astronomers, however, have nothing to hand you. They are bruised; their knuckles are bloodied. \We had an academic disagreement,\ one says. \Let it suffice to say we fell in love and that bred hate. We're better now that we've stopped looking at the star, however.\=然而，天文学家们没有什么可以交给你。他们伤痕累累；他们的指关节血迹斑斑。\我们有一个学术分歧，一个人说。\我想说的是，我们相爱了，却产生了仇恨。不过，现在我们不再看那颗星了，我们会好一些。

After the Titanians have all filtered in, you are allowed a great honour: to stand on the bar, lay out the rules, and - by your sole discretion - decide the victors. Your arbitration bolsters some and destroys others. But truly, most of them should feel no shame: the quality of the lyrics they fish from their mugs is far superior to what one hears in London. Except for the songs of the Red-feathered Warbler. They deserve to feel ashamed of themselves.=在泰坦尼克号全部过滤完毕后，你被允许有一个巨大的荣誉：站在吧台上，制定规则，并且--由你独自决定--决定胜利者。你的仲裁支持了一些人，破坏了另一些人。但实际上，他们中的大多数人不应该感到羞耻：他们从杯子里捞出的歌词的质量远远超过在伦敦听到的。除了红羽毛莺的歌曲。他们应该为自己感到羞耻。
After the Titanians have all filtered in, the rules are set: every half hour, each participant will be given a glass of wine. If they do not finish it by the time the next round is served, they are disqualified. The last one remaining wins. What happens next, however, is uncertain. The identity of the winner is a mystery, as is the identity of the one who stole the Empress' bust from its glass case. As a point in fact, the whole week afterward is blurry. But you're certain it was a fine time, after the headaches end.=在泰坦人全部过滤完毕后，规则就定下来了：每隔半小时，每个参与者将得到一杯酒。如果他们在下一轮酒上桌时没有喝完，就会被取消资格。最后剩下的人获胜。然而，接下来会发生什么，是不确定的。赢家的身份是一个谜，就像从玻璃柜中偷出皇后半身像的人的身份一样。事实上，之后的整个一周都是模糊的。但你可以肯定那是一段美好的时光，在令人头疼的结束之后。

The Bishop gives praise and honour to every screw, every nail, every wingnut and gear - and every sheet of metal, plank of wood, and all the components they come together to create - in his benediction. It takes a long time, but it's a fitting tribute to your vessel. It is blessed in the name of Her Majesty the Enduring Empress.=主教在他的祝词中对每一颗螺丝、每一颗钉子、每一个翼片和齿轮--以及每一块金属板、木板和它们共同创造的所有部件--给予赞美和尊敬。这需要很长的时间，但这是对你的船只的一个恰当的赞美。它是以持久女皇陛下的名义被祝福的。

You take a private booth. The opera is a new farce to the Titanians, though old to you and yours. At least they cast you as a comedic hero and give you the best songs. Even if their version of the heroic is excessively libertine. The Empire would not approve.=你坐一个私人包间。这部歌剧对泰坦人来说是一场新的闹剧，虽然对你和你的人来说是旧的。至少他们让你扮演一个喜剧英雄，给你最好的歌曲。即使他们的英雄版本是过度放纵的。帝国是不会同意的。
All that time spent practising your arias on the deck pays off now. For just a little while, you're in the world of music: one that's bright, bubbly, free - free from the stodgy and hateful and oppressive.=所有在甲板上练习咏叹调的时间现在得到了回报。仅仅一小会儿，你就进入了音乐的世界：一个明亮的、冒泡的、自由的--从呆板的、可恨的和压抑的中解放出来。

\Do you know that the rate of scientific discovery is increasing exponentially?\ says the Studious Forged Companion. \By comparing evidence from texts written at different points within the last one thousand years, we can, if our minds are open to the possibilities, envision the revelations that will be made ten, fifty, even a hundred years from now.\\n\nThe Companion does not attempt to explain how they arrived at their extraordinary conclusions, but instead fills you with wonder at the future awaiting the terrestrial and skyfaring alike.=Studious Forged Companion说：你知道科学发现的速度正以指数形式增长吗？\通过比较过去一千年内不同时间点的文字证据，如果我们的思想对各种可能性持开放态度，我们可以预见十年、五十年、甚至一百年后的启示。《同伴》并不试图解释他们如何得出非凡的结论，而是让你对等待陆地和天空的未来充满了好奇。
The Pugilsitic Forged Companion strides towards you, their body glowing in the dark cabin. Their first punch catches you in the jaw; the explosion of pain is exhilarating. You try to retaliate, but the Companion's movements are arrhythmic and unpredictable. The few retaliatory blows you land are absorbed by their elastic skin.\n\nWhen the Companion judges that you have relieved enough tension, it darts behind you, strikes your knees from behind and kicks you in the back just as your legs buckle. \n\nThe blood rushes in your ears as you clamber back to your feet, and you feel more alert than you have for days.=普格斯特锻造的同伴大步向你走来，他们的身体在黑暗的机舱里闪闪发光。他们的第一拳打在了你的下巴上；疼痛的爆发让人振奋。你试图反击，但同伴的动作是有节奏的、不可预知的。当同伴判断你已经缓解了足够的紧张感时，它就飞快地跑到你身后，从后面击打你的膝盖，并在你的腿弯曲时踢你的背部。\当你重新站起来的时候，血液在你的耳边涌动，你感到比几天前更加警觉。
The Illusive Forged Companion picks up the watch by the chain, so that it swings from their glowing hand. In their expressionless voice, they describe the oscillation of the watch so that you cannot help but focus all of your attention upon it. \n\nThe Companion continues to talk, but you cannot remember their words from moment to moment, so absorbed are you by the swaying of the metal disc. There is a tickle at your ankle and you reach down to brush away  a spider! Then another little beast is crawling up your neck, and inside your sleeves, and \n\nbut there are no spiders. The Companion returns to their card tricks.=虚幻的锻造同伴用链子挑起了手表，让它从他们发光的手上摇晃。他们用毫无表情的声音描述着手表的摆动，使你不由自主地将所有的注意力集中在它身上。\同伴继续说话，但你无法记住他们每时每刻的话，你被金属圆盘的摇摆所吸引。你的脚踝处传来痒痒的感觉，你伸手拂去一只蜘蛛！然后又有一只小兽爬到你身上。然后又有一只小兽爬上你的脖子，在你的袖子里爬来爬去，但是没有蜘蛛。同伴们回到了他们的牌技中。
The Illusive Forged Companion is practicing mesmerism on a glassy-eyed mouse.=虚幻的锻造同伴正在对一只玻璃眼的老鼠进行迷魂术。

The Poetic Forged Companion gives you a volume of poetry. Its use of language is unorthodox, yet the concerns it wrestles with are universal.=《诗意的锻造伴侣》给了你一卷诗意。它的语言使用是非正统的，但它所涉及的问题是普遍的。

The crew are sprawled at the feet of the Poetic Forged Companion, who is reading their latest composition aloud. Heads lolling, jaws slack, the crew stare witlessly at the Companion, completely intoxicated by their verse.=船员们匍匐在诗意锻造的同伴脚下，他正在大声朗读他们最新的作品。脑袋耷拉着，下巴松弛着，船员们无精打采地盯着同伴，完全陶醉在他们的诗句中。
The intervention needs to be dramatic if it is to wrench the crew from their stupor.=如果要把船员们从昏迷中解救出来，干预就必须具有戏剧性。
You conjure memories of the long hours your crew have spent toiling in the cold with you, the times you have saved their lives and they yours, and desperately urge them to listen to you, their captain, and return to their duties.\n\nWiping the drool from their mouths, they turn their attention away from the Poetic Forged Companion and stagger to their feet. The Companion continues to recite their poetry in a toneless voice, unperturbed by the disappearance of their audience.\n\nIt is troubling that such effort should be required to impel the crew to do their jobs. What is more, the same speech will not have an impact a second time.=你想起了你的船员在寒冷中与你一起度过的漫长时光，想起了你救过他们的命，也救过他们的命，拼命劝他们听你这个船长的话，回到他们的岗位上去。擦掉嘴里的口水，他们把注意力从诗意锻造的同伴身上移开，踉跄着站了起来。同伴继续用无声的声音朗诵他们的诗歌，没有因为听众的消失而感到不安。这令人不安的是，需要这样的努力来促使船员们完成他们的工作。更重要的是，同样的讲话不会有第二次的影响。
The Illusive Companion hypnotises your crew, softly reciting a mantra about your physical power. Impressed, the mesmerised crew stare at you in awe. \Pardon me,\ says a signaller in a dreamy voice, \but since you are so strong, do you think you could move my bunk into a more comfortable position? It is welded to the floor, but I am sure you could manage.\=虚幻的同伴对你的船员进行催眠，轻声念着关于你身体力量的咒语。印象深刻，被迷住的船员们敬畏地盯着你。\一个信号员用梦幻般的声音说：请原谅，但既然你这么强壮，你能不能把我的床铺移到一个更舒适的位置？它被焊接在地板上，但我相信你可以做到。
The Illusive Forged Companion is entertaining the crew by hypnotising them. At first, the volunteers believe themselves to be chickens, much to their crew mates' amusement, but before long the Companion is convincing them that they are floating through the Wilderness, with no hope of recovery. The volunteers panic.=虚幻的锻造同伴正在通过催眠他们来娱乐船员。起初，志愿者们认为自己是鸡，这让他们的船员们很开心，但不久之后，这个同伴就说服他们，他们正在荒野中漂浮，没有希望恢复。志愿者们惊慌失措。
You push the gemstones into the eye sockets. The starshine has become gelatinous, so the stones quiver on the surface rather than sinking to the back of the head. =你把宝石推到眼窝里。星光已经变成胶状，所以宝石在表面颤抖，而不是沉到头的后面。
You push the seeds into the eye sockets. The starshine has become gelatinous, so they quiver on the surface rather than sinking to the back of the head. In the light from the furnace, the seeds look dark and inscrutable; it is impossible to tell where the Companion is looking.=你把种子推到眼窝里。星光已经变成胶状，所以它们在表面颤抖，而不是沉到脑后。在炉子的光线下，种子看起来黑乎乎的，难以捉摸；无法分辨同伴在看什么。
softly glowing=柔和地发亮
You press the point of the blade against the taut skin of their chest. As soon as it pierces the thick membrane, starshine spurts out, drenching your hand and splashing onto the floor. The Companion crumples to its knees.\n\nOnce the last of the starshine has trickled away, all that remains is the Companion's damp, twitching skin, =你把刀尖压在他们胸前紧绷的皮肤上。当它刺穿厚厚的薄膜时，星光喷涌而出，淋湿了你的手，溅到地板上。一旦最后的星光流走，只剩下同伴潮湿的、抽搐的皮肤。
It leaves, clenching its starshine-filled fists with a soft squelch.=它离开了，紧握着它充满星光的拳头，发出一声轻响。
Every blow from their starshine-filled fists lands with a squelch, and before long the crew lie sprawled upon the floor, clutching their wounds.=它们充满星光的拳头的每一次击打都伴随着一阵阵吱吱声，没过多久，船员们就躺在地板上，攥着他们的伤口。
squelching their liquid-filled knuckles=挤压着他们充满液体的指关节
It is no good; the bunk is far too heavy to lift. The dreamy look in the signaller's eyes fades as they watch you struggle. \You know,\ they say, their voice hardening, \I had the strangest dream. You were there, except you were as strong as a Clay Man. Most odd. Must have been something I ate.\=没有用的，床铺太重了，抬不动。看着你的挣扎，信号员眼中的梦幻般的神情逐渐消失。\他们说：你知道吗，他们的声音变硬了，我做了一个最奇怪的梦。你在那里，只是你像粘土人一样强壮。最奇怪的是。一定是我吃了什么东西。
The Illusive Forged Companion whispers a stream of instructions: concentrate on your breath, you are the breath, drifting through the Wilderness, unfettered by\n\nYou grasp the delicately-painted crockery tightly as the hallucination becomes more vivid. Whenever the vertigo of the illusory Wilderness threatens to overwhelm you, you focus your attention on the cool china beneath your fingertips.\n\nOnce the Companion stops whispering, you are less afraid, more able to face the challenges ahead. Unfortunately, you are also surrounded by broken crockery, and your hands are riddled with porcelain splinters.=虚幻的同伴低声说着一系列的指示：集中注意力在你的呼吸上，你就是呼吸，在荒野中漂流，不受约束。你紧紧抓住画得精致的陶器，因为幻觉变得更加生动。Whenever the vertigo of the illusory Wilderness threatens to overwhelm you, you focus your attention on the cool china beneath your fingertips.一旦同伴停止低语，你就不再害怕，更有能力面对前面的挑战。不幸的是，你也被破碎的陶器所包围，你的手被瓷器的碎片弄得千疮百孔。
The Illusive Forged Companion whispers a stream of instructions: concentrate on your breath, you are the breath, drifting through the Wilderness, unfettered by\n\nYour hallucinatory flight through the illusory Wilderness becomes more vivid, but you never feel afraid. On the contrary, the aimless drifting soothes your turbulent mind.\n\nAfter some time, you gradually return to your senses. It is as if you have been on a restorative holiday, and you feel calmer, more rested, and better equipped to face the challenges ahead. It is only when you realise that you have been in a trance for three days that your sense of well-being is tempered with annoyance.=虚幻的锻造伴侣低声说着一股指令：专注于你的呼吸，你就是呼吸，在荒野中漂流，不受约束 by/n/n你在虚幻的荒野中的幻觉飞行变得更加生动，但你从未感到害怕。相反，漫无目的的漂流使你动荡的心灵得到安抚。一段时间后，你逐渐恢复了你的感觉。就像你已经度过了一个恢复性的假期，你感觉更平静，更有活力，更有能力去面对未来的挑战。只有当你意识到你已经恍惚了三天，你的幸福感才会被恼怒所取代。
I hypnotised them to ease their anxiety. They supplied the drinks themselves.=我对他们进行催眠，以缓解他们的焦虑。他们自己提供饮料。
The Pugilistic Forged Companion descends upon the crew. Every blow from their starshine-filled fists lands with a squelch, and before long the crew lie sprawled upon the floor, clutching their wounds. One of them lies motionless on the floor, so battered you cannot determine their identity. At least they will need no more supplies.=帕格利特锻造的同伴降临在船员身上。他们充满星光的拳头的每一击都带着压迫感，没过多久，船员们就躺在地板上，紧紧抓住他们的伤口。他们中的一个人躺在地上一动不动，被打得遍体鳞伤，你无法确定他们的身份。至少他们不需要更多的补给了。

The Hermit's puckered skin is a mass of fungal blooms and the purple-leafed flowers of twilight. They tend to them with a sliver of obsidian, delicately carving weeds from their flesh.=隐士的褶皱皮肤是一团真菌的花朵和暮色中的紫叶花。他们用一截黑曜石照料它们，从它们的肉体上精巧地雕刻出杂草。
The air hangs heavy with the ancient stench of blood, gristle and decaying flesh. The Hermit kneels by the still breathing body of some no longer identifiable animal, their sticky fingers questing for whatever wisdom may lie within flesh and bones.=空气中弥漫着古老的血腥味、肉汁和腐烂的肉体的臭味。隐士们跪在一些不再可辨认的动物的仍在呼吸的尸体旁，他们粘稠的手指在探寻肉和骨头中可能存在的智慧。
The Hermit drags a sharp rock through their flesh, carving spiral patterns on already bloodied skin. Their milky-grey eyes stare at something beyond the cave wall. Their whispers could as easily be prophecy or madness.=隐士将一块锋利的石头拖过他们的肉，在已经沾满血迹的皮肤上刻下螺旋状的图案。他们乳灰色的眼睛盯着洞壁之外的东西。他们的低语很可能是预言或疯狂。

The Hermit sits motionless, meditating under a steady drip of water that feeds their garden of flesh. Their unblinking eyes pay you no attention as you take the candle deeper into the cave. Roses bloom in the dark, curling up and dying in the presence of the light.=隐士一动不动地坐着，在养活他们的肉体花园的稳定水滴下沉思。当你拿着蜡烛深入洞中时，他们一眨不眨的眼睛没有注意到你。玫瑰花在黑暗中绽放，在光线的照射下蜷缩起来并死去。
The Hermit whispers to the darkness. They pay you no mind as you look at their few remaining possessions. A trading log from a place far away, a faded photo of a love last seen in Old London. A diary that begins with scholarly descriptions of Eleutherian wonders and ends with nothing but scribbles of the same eye carved into their flesh. The last coherent entry is dated November 1886. =隐士对黑暗低语。当你看着他们所剩无几的财产时，他们对你毫不在意。一本来自遥远地方的贸易日志，一张最后在旧伦敦看到的爱情的褪色照片。一本日记，开始是对伊莱塞特奇迹的学术性描述，最后只剩下刻在他们肉体上的那只眼睛的潦草文字。最后一条连贯的条目是1886年11月的。
The Hermit works their haruspicy on the dying beast, occasionally pausing to stroke its fur and close its eyes to the pain. Their cave is filled with bones and rotting meat and a smell that makes your eyes water. Amongst them is the wreckage of what appears to be a zubmarine. A second glance at the bones reveals that not all of them are from animals.=隐士们在垂死的野兽身上施展他们的haruspicy，偶尔暂停一下，抚摸它的皮毛，闭上眼睛忍受痛苦。他们的洞穴里充满了骨头和腐烂的肉，还有一股让人眼睛发亮的味道。在这些骨头中，有一具似乎是潜水艇的残骸。再看一眼这些骨头，就会发现并不是所有的骨头都是动物的。
The Hermit finishes carving their latest spiral and takes a drink from a gentle trickle of water running down from the roof of the cave. Their milky-grey eyes stare past you; their mouth occasionally forms a coherent word. Sweat builds on their brow. Their words might be truth, falsehood, or any flavour of madness in between.=隐士 完成了他们最新的螺旋形雕刻，从洞顶流下的涓涓细流中喝了一口水。他们乳灰色的眼睛盯着你过去；他们的嘴偶尔形成一个连贯的词。汗水在他们的额头上积聚。他们的话可能是真理，也可能是假话，或者是介于两者之间的任何疯狂的味道。
HermitSecret=隐士的秘密
The Hermit cups their hands beneath a gentle trickle of foul smelling water. They drink, then their words flow freely. They speak of the great charnel houses of Europe. How the Eagle will fight the Bear. How the Clockwork God will fall. A whisper of your own future too, never intended for your ears. A warning of what you may become in the dark.=隐士把他们的手放在散发着恶臭的水的温柔涓流下面。他们喝了水，然后他们的话语自由地流淌。他们谈到了欧洲的大墓室。鹰将如何与熊战斗。发条神将如何堕落。这也是你自己未来的低语，从未打算让你听到。一个关于你在黑暗中可能成为什么的警告。
The Hermit's words are rapid in pace and low on coherence. They speak while painting a picture on the wall; another eye, like the one in their tattoo. Now your vision has adjusted, just a little, to the darkness, you can see the same symbol emblazoned a thousand times across the walls, sometimes open, often closed. Just for a moment, you understand. Just for a moment, you see.=隐士的话语节奏很快，连贯性不强。他们一边说，一边在墙上画了一幅画；另一只眼睛，就像他们纹身里的那只。现在你的视力已经适应了，仅仅是一点点，适应了黑暗，你可以看到同样的符号在墙上印了一千次，有时是打开的，经常是关闭的。就在这一瞬间，你明白了。只是一瞬间，你就看到了。
The Hermit cuts a purple flower from their shoulder, licking the blood from the stem. They wrap it tight and place it in an old chipped cup full of gathered rainwater, stirring with the obsidian shard until it runs dark. They offer it. There is no refusing. When you wake up, only blessed fragments of nightmare remain. Burning at their core is an eye; the same one you now see repeated again and again in the Hermit's garden of flesh.=隐士从他们的肩膀上切下一朵紫色的花，舔着茎上的血。他们把它包得严严实实，放在一个旧的碎玻璃杯里，里面装满了收集的雨水，用黑曜石碎片搅拌，直到它流下黑水。他们提供它。没有人拒绝。当你醒来时，只剩下受祝福的噩梦碎片。在它们的核心燃烧的是一只眼睛；也就是你现在看到的在隐士的肉体花园里一次又一次重复的那只眼睛。
The Hermit accepts your offering and gestures for you to join them; to soothe the dying animal's pain in its last moments. They sift their fingers through its insides, plucking out organs and placing them on the ground in a careful but indecipherable pattern. When it is complete, the Hermit rests a compassionate hand on the beast's head and slits its throat in a smooth, practised manner. What they hoped to learn from this goes unspoken, but as you stand to leave, you see the pattern. An eye.=隐士接受了你的供品，并示意你加入他们；在最后时刻抚慰垂死动物的痛苦。他们用手指筛查它的内脏，拔出器官，并把它们放在地上，形成一个小心翼翼但难以辨认的图案。当它完成后，隐士将一只慈悲的手放在野兽的头上，以一种平稳、熟练的方式割断它的喉咙。他们希望从这里学到什么没有说出来，但当你站起来准备离开时，你看到了这个图案。一只眼睛。

I received word that I've been commended by some Hall or another, in my absence.\=你最近去了伦敦吗？刚才我突然想到，我几乎记不起那个地方了。\他转身看着窗外，看着那可笑的基鲁宾水景。\我一直认为这是我的家。但显然它不可能是。 \他大声地笑了起来。\不过，知道他们欣赏我的工作，这很好。我收到消息说，在我不在的时候，我受到了某个大厅的赞扬。
\I've been thinking of varying the stops on the tour of Brabazon. But I don't want to increase the strain on the workers. They always like to put on an extra effort when we have guests, and if I change their routine...\ \n\nHe shakes his head. \No, we'll stick with what we have. It's very representative, after all. Have you been on it?\=我一直在考虑改变布拉巴宗之行的站点。但我不想增加工人们的负担。当我们有客人时，他们总是喜欢付出额外的努力，如果我改变他们的常规...... \他摇了摇头。\不，我们会坚持我们的做法。毕竟，它很有代表性。Have you been on it?
The Governor has his back to you, and doesn't see you enter. He's miming conducting to some jolly little tune on the gramophone. Is that something by Gilbert and Sullivan? Best leave him to it. =总督背对着你，并没有看到你进来。他正在为留声机上的一些欢快的小曲子模仿指挥。那是吉尔伯特和沙利文的作品吗？最好让他去做。
The Governor stands by the window. He looks past the tasteless fountain to where an Overseer is sweeping up leaves. \This man here: came here with his parents and worked his way up. Paid off their debts entirely. In a few months, he should be able to afford to leave. I've arranged for him to visit Lustrum as soon as he can afford the fare.\=总督站在窗边。他看了看无味的喷泉，看到一个监督员正在清扫树叶。\这个人：和他的父母一起来到这里，一路工作。完全还清了他们的债务。几个月后，他应该有能力离开。我已经为他安排好了，只要他能付得起车费，就可以去访问拉斯特伦。
\A pleasure to see you. I have a soft spot for locomotive captains. So much plainer speaking than merchants and lawyers.\ \n\nHe stubs out his cigar. \Apparently I had an uncle who captained a locomotive. Destroyed by a scrive spinster. My mother dined off the tale for months. Everyone found it terribly romantic.\ He looks puzzled for a moment. \Not sure why.\=很高兴见到你。我对机车车长情有独钟。比起商人和律师，他们说话更朴实。\他抽出了他的雪茄。\显然，我有个叔叔当过机车车长。被一个老处女毁掉了。我的母亲靠这个故事吃了好几个月。每个人都觉得它非常浪漫。他看了一会儿，很不解。\不知道为什么。
\I'm immensely proud of our workers. Industry's up. Our hour refining is more efficient than ever. Our weavers are the best in the region. I've even heard rumours that Her Renewed Majesty commented positively on a glass piece made by one of our very own blowers.\ He beams at you. \Albion wouldn't be the same without them.\=我为我们的工人感到无比的骄傲。工业的发展。我们的炼油厂比以前更有效率。我们的织工是这个地区最好的。我甚至听到传言说，女王陛下对我们自己的一个吹奏者制作的玻璃制品给予了积极的评价。他对你笑了笑。\没有他们，阿尔比恩就不一样了。
You enter to catch the Governor performing callisthenics. You can't tell if he blushes  his face is flushed already. \It's important to exercise regularly. Keeps one young.\=你进门时看到总督在做呼气式运动。你无法判断他是否脸红，他的脸已经红了。\经常锻炼是很重要的。让人保持年轻。
He points out a plaque on the wall. \This is a list of the original donors, who helped us set up Brabazon Workworld. They've all contributed to this place: a place where the destitute can learn new skills, and find a home.\ He leans back in his desk chair. \Some donors visit Brabazon to ensure their good work continues.\=他指着墙上的一块牌子。\这是一份最初捐赠者的名单，他们帮助我们建立了布拉巴宗工作世界。他们都为这个地方做出了贡献：在这个地方，穷人可以学习新的技能，并找到一个家。他靠在他的办公椅上。\一些捐赠者访问Brabazon，以确保他们的良好工作继续下去。
AirsBetween=AirsBetween
Overseers scurry back and forth along the glass tunnel, clumping at the Little Nice end. As they enter Little Nice they remove grimy capes to reveal cheery red and white striped blazers. These are hung up to be collected on their re-entrance to the Bit Between. None seem willing to stop and talk.=监督员们沿着玻璃隧道来回奔跑，在小尼斯的一端聚集。当他们进入小尼斯时，他们脱下肮脏的斗篷，露出欢快的红色和白色条纹的夹克。这些衣服被挂起来，在他们重新进入位面之间时被收集。似乎没有人愿意停下来说话。
A middle-aged man pushes a handtruck of crates from Brabazon to the docking area. The Overseer beside him adds her weight to assist. You hear snatches of their conversation. \Mother! Stop helping. You'll be made to join us.\ The woman's laugh is high and nervous. \twice my own age. And you want me to stay away?\ She sees you and is instantly formal. \I'm sorry, Captain. These goods are allotted to another locomotive.\=一个中年男子推着一辆手推车，把布拉巴宗的箱子推到了码头区。他身旁的监督员增加了她的体重来协助。你听到他们的对话片段。\妈妈！。不要再帮忙了。你会被要求加入我们。那个女人的笑声高亢而紧张。\我的年龄是我的两倍。你想让我离开吗？她看到你，立刻变得很正式。\I'm sorry, Captain. 这些货物被分配给了另一个火车头。
The Overseer is folding his work cape up rather than hanging it. He places it in a storage bench opposite the dock. He beams when you approach him. \I've been promoted to gardener. I'll be living and working in Little Nice, from now. And to think, I was warned away from flirting with the donors.\=监督员正在将他的工作斗篷折叠起来，而不是挂起来。他把它放在码头对面的一个储物长椅上。当你走近他时，他笑了。\我已经被提升为园丁。从现在开始，我将在小尼斯生活和工作。想想看，我被警告过不要和捐赠者调情。
\Are you one of our donors? No? My mistake.\ The Overseer tuts at the list in their hands. \All our major donors have expressed a wish to see the result of their good works. It's too much to ask that they arrive on time. Bl___y rich b\ Abruptly aware that you have not moved on, she blanches. \That... that was a joke. Please don't mention it.\=你是我们的捐助者之一吗？不是吗？我的错误。监督员看着他们手中的名单，啧啧称奇。\我们所有的主要捐赠者都表示希望看到他们善举的结果。要求他们准时到达，这太过分了。Bl___y rich b\ 突然意识到你没有继续前进，她脸色一变。\那......那是个玩笑。Please don't mention it.
You catch the Overseer's eye just as she's putting on her work cape. She nods and comes over. \My shift's not for a couple of hours. I can spare a minute.\ She smiles warmly; a practised smile. \I help with the tour. The best role available off Little Nice. I thoroughly recommend it. And if you go, could you put a word in for me? With the board?\ She checks her watch and sets off at a trot.=你吸引了监督员的注意，因为她正在穿她的工作披风。她点点头，走了过来。\我的班还有几个小时才结束。我可以抽出一点时间。她热情地笑了笑；这是一个成熟的笑容。\我帮助参观。这是 小尼斯 以外最好的角色。我完全推荐它。如果你去了，你能为我说句话吗？在董事会那里？她看了看表，然后小跑着出发了。
\I'm terribly sorry, I don't have permission to speak with you.\ The Overseer is supervising a small group of workers loading crates onto a,我非常抱歉，我没有权限和你说话。 监督员正在监督一小群工人将板条箱装到一辆车中。

NewWinchester=NewWinchester
As you finish, a Dignified Gentleman of Leisure passes by, back from several months spent circumnavigating the known Wilderness. \Have no fear, gentle Pasporto. When I made my grand wager, I was sure to factor in that New Winchester is typically a full day behind Albion time. We have-\ He looks up at the clock and falls to his knees. \No!\ he screams. \I am ruined!\=当你完成时，一位有身份的休闲绅士经过，他在已知的荒野上环游了几个月后回来。\不要害怕，温柔的Pasporto。当我打出我的大赌注时，我肯定会考虑到新温彻斯特通常比阿尔比恩时间晚一整天。我们有...... 他抬头看了看时钟，然后跪倒在地。\不！他尖叫起来。\我被毁了！
As you return from the clock, you pass an Usurious Landlord waving his chalk at a desperate family. \Three of the clock, I said, and not a second later! Is it my fault that the clocks today are as reliable as your word? Humbug! To the poorhouse with the lot of you!\=当你从时钟那里回来时，你经过一个高利贷地主，向一个绝望的家庭挥舞他的粉笔。\Three of the clock, I said, and not a second later! 今天的时钟和你的话一样可靠，这是我的错吗？哼！。你们这些人都去贫民窟吧！
As you finish, the Murderous Sort in the court looks up at the clock with a smug expression. \Where was I at the time of the murders, mi'lud? Why, I will be right here, mi'lud. And so will all of you.\ By law, the alibi stands.=当你说完时，法庭上的杀人狂魔抬头看了看时钟，露出了得意的表情。\谋杀发生时我在哪里，伙计？为什么，我就在这里，老兄。你们所有人也会在这里。 根据法律，不在场证明成立。
PortAvon=阿文港
As you pass the small schoolhouse, a bored child slumps at an uncomfortable wooden desk. Just another ten minutes until freedom. Five minutes. But no. Suddenly the hands on the port clock begin turning backwards; the afternoon and the morning peeling away hour by hour. The Stern Schoolmistress raps her cane against the table. \Enough! Back to the start of today's lesson...\=当你经过小校舍时，一个无聊的孩子在一张不舒服的木头桌子上耷拉着脑袋。离自由还有十分钟。五分钟。但是没有。突然间，港口时钟的指针开始向后转动；下午和上午的时间一个小时一个小时地剥落。斯特恩女教师用手杖敲打着桌子。\够了！。回到今天的课程开始......
You return to the train past the now exhausted farmhand, earnestly trying to milk a cow that was milked only a few hours ago and is frankly little happier at the whole affair. He stifles a yawn just long enough to shoot you a foul look.=你回到火车上，经过那个疲惫不堪的农场工人，他正在认真地给一头几小时前才挤过奶的奶牛挤奶，坦率地说，他对整个事情并不感到高兴。他打了个哈欠，向你投来鄙夷的目光。
You climb down from the clock into a bitter wedding argument. It appears that both bride and groom are already married - to each other. The paperwork does not lie! In shame, both families call the whole thing off, with the unlucky couple left to work out whether they are or not now living in sin.=你从钟上爬下来，进入一场痛苦的婚礼争论。看来新娘和新郎都已经结婚了--彼此都是。文件上没有说谎！。羞愧之下，两家人都取消了整个婚礼，而这对不幸的夫妇则被留了下来，以解决他们现在是否生活在罪孽之中。
Magdelenes=Magdelenes
With the clock fixed, the business of the place ticks on. Once a treatment begins, time flows on its own schedule anyway, be clients distracted by the pleasure of massage, the pain of loss, or the confusion of seeing the Empress staring in horror at a mirror, rubbing her face as if in a desperate attempt to rub away something that has been fixed in place for just a little too long.=随着时钟的固定，这里的业务也在不断发展。一旦治疗开始，无论如何，时间都会按照自己的时间表流动，无论客户是被按摩的快感、失去的痛苦，还是看到皇后惊恐地盯着镜子，揉着脸，仿佛在拼命擦去已经固定在那里太久的东西的困惑。
The clock is fixed, though none pay it much attention. The clouds of hookah smoke emerging from the quieter rooms do more to toy with the passing of time than a crate of fresh Hours, never mind a little tinkering around with something as banal as a clock.=钟是固定的，尽管没有人对它给予过多的关注。从较安静的房间里冒出的烟云比一箱新鲜的小时数更能让人感受到时间的流逝，更不用说对时钟这样平淡无奇的东西做一点手脚了。
Having fixed the clock, you hunt down the members of your crew who are enjoying the facilities. Most look relaxed and able, save for one who has to be carried back to the train on a stretcher. His face is locked in a rictus grin; still trembling, with eyes wide and requiring regular drops of salt-water to remain moisturised. His worried attendant refuses to divulge the precise nature of his requested treatment. It can however be assumed that he found the exact moment it became too much of a good thing.=修好时钟后，你找到了正在享受这些设施的船员。大多数人看起来都很轻松，很能干，只有一个人不得不用担架抬回火车。他的脸被锁在一个狂妄的笑容里；仍然在颤抖，眼睛睁得大大的，需要经常滴盐水来保持湿润。他担心的服务员拒绝透露他所要求的治疗的确切性质。不过，可以推测，他确切地找到了它变得太过美好的时刻。
Brabazon=布拉巴宗
You climb down from the clock, overhearing one of the overseers tell your guide, \I'm sorry, but your indentured service was due to end on February 29th, and it appears, ah, that you missed it. Still, think how lucky you are to have a guaranteed job for the next four years!\=你从钟上爬下来，听到一个监工对你的向导说：很抱歉，你的契约服务本应在2月29日结束，看来啊，你错过了。不过，想想你是多么幸运，在接下来的四年里有一份有保障的工作！
As you leave, your job complete, a small riot is breaking out. It would be larger, but most of the workers are too exhausted and in need of a little rest and recreation. Your adjustments should ensure their working conditions remain arduous rather than torturous, at least for a while.=当你离开时，你的工作完成了，一场小规模的骚乱正在爆发。它将会更大，但大多数工人都太累了，需要一点休息和娱乐。你的调整应该确保他们的工作条件仍然是艰苦的，而不是折磨人的，至少在一段时间内。
You leave to find the exhausted miner being wheeled away, twenty-three hours into what now shows on the paperwork as an eight hour shift. He is fined for not seeing it through to the end.=你离开时发现疲惫不堪的矿工被推走了，现在文件上显示是八小时的班，已经过了二十三个小时。他因为没有坚持到最后而被罚款。
Carillon=卡里昂
Not far from the clock, you spy a diligent deviless checking on one of her charges. Their therapy and penance is listed as spending five minutes sealed in a mahogany box with a hundred and seventy seven spiders. Those five minutes are due to be over in... she checks... yes, another fourteen hours. Idly humming, she continues her rounds.=在离时钟不远的地方，你看到一个勤奋的女魔头在检查她的一个指控。他们的治疗和忏悔被列为在一个有一百七十七只蜘蛛的桃花心木箱中度过五分钟。这五分钟将在......她检查......是的，再过十四个小时就会结束。悠闲地哼着歌，她继续她的巡视。
The Presiding Deviless is waiting for you outside the clocktower, already dealing with a new set of prospective patients arriving before the previous penitents have parted. \Order them all packed into the brimstone sauna,\ she tells an assistant. \Then lock the door.\=主持工作的女魔头在钟楼外等着你，已经在处理一组新的准病人，他们在以前的忏悔者离开之前就已经到了。\她对一个助手说：命令他们全部挤进硫磺石桑拿房，。\然后锁上门。
You leave the clock as a strait-jacketed penitent is dragged kicking and protesting from the peace of the gardens to the screams of the dining hall. Through blistered lips, she protests she already ate a thousand nettles today. The devils ignore her obvious excuses. The lunch bell, they respect.=你离开时钟时，一个身穿紧身衣的忏悔者被踢着、抗议着从花园的宁静中拖到饭厅的尖叫声中。她用起泡的嘴唇抗议说她今天已经吃了一千根荨麻。魔鬼们不理会她明显的借口。他们尊重午餐铃声。
Eagles=老鹰
Leaving the clock, you see the Khan's collectors arrive to demand the Embassy's taxes. \But they were paid yesterday!\ protests the Ambassador. But as yesterday now no longer officially existed according to the Embassy's records, all paperwork to that effect is a clear forgery. He is dragged off by the guards to explain himself to the Khan.=离开时钟，你看到大汗的收税员来到这里，要求缴纳大使馆的税收。\大使抗议说：但他们昨天已经交过了！。但根据大使馆的记录，昨天已经不存在了，所有的文件都是伪造的。他被卫兵拖去向大汗解释。
As you conclude your work, members of the Empyrean Foreign Office watch in quiet amusement as the Londoners scrabble to adjust. Later, they will see which contracts and deals with the Embassy can be most profitably broken. For now, however, the show is enough.=当你结束你的工作时，帝国外交部的成员们静静地看着伦敦人拼命地调整，感到很好笑。稍后，他们将看到哪些与大使馆的合同和交易可以最有利地被打破。不过，现在，这场表演已经足够了。
As you finish your work, the Khan's enforcers are wasting no time tracking down London diplomats whose domicile rights have expired. The richest are welcomed to settle the matter with the currency of their choice. The rest soon find their visas claimed by the Eagle, and are deported on the first available trains with little but the clothes on their backs, and no thought given to the damage to the London Embassy's schedules.=当你完成你的工作时，大汗的执法者们正在不遗余力地追踪那些居住权已经过期的伦敦外交官们。最富有的人被欢迎用他们选择的货币来解决这个问题。其余的人很快就会发现他们的签证被 老鹰 拿走了，他们被送上了第一班火车，除了身上的衣服，没有考虑到对伦敦大使馆日程的破坏。
Worlebury=Worlebury
Deep in the mists, the two lovers in their diving bell begin wondering exactly when it will be time to return to the surface. They have no way of knowing that the attendant above has clocked off, assuming his replacement will be there in minutes rather than the hours it will actually be. They tell each other not to worry and curl up happily in each others' arms, breathing each others' scent until they can no longer keep their eyes open.=在迷雾深处，潜水钟里的两个恋人开始琢磨到底什么时候才能回到地面。他们没有办法知道上面的服务员已经打卡下班了，假设他的替代者会在几分钟内到达，而不是实际上的几个小时。他们告诉对方不要担心，并快乐地蜷缩在对方的怀里，呼吸着对方的气味，直到他们再也无法睁开眼睛。
Miserable holiday-makers shuffle past you in a mood of gloom, their holidays abruptly ended and the real world calling again. You have not made any friends here today.=悲惨的度假者在阴郁的气氛中从你身边走过，他们的假期突然结束，现实世界再次召唤。你今天在这里没有交到任何朋友。
You return to the pier to find guests who had been looking forward to celebrating the Festival of the Sea instead surrounded by half-painted decorations, bunting still in its crates, and tables laden with undercooked meats that ooze when pierced. Worlebury rumbles to the sounds of disappointment, displeasure, and later, intense food poisoning.=你回到码头，发现原本期待着庆祝海洋节的客人，却被半漆的装饰品、仍在板条箱中的旗帜和满载未煮熟的肉类的桌子所包围，一戳就渗出。沃尔伯里在失望、不悦和后来强烈的食物中毒的声音中隆隆作响。
Prosper=繁荣
As you return from your duties, a Windward Inspector is smiling unpleasantly at the Captain from Lustrum. \Due this morning, these were. If you didn't want your kids starving, should've stuck to your schedule.\ He sucks happily on a boiled sweet. \Shall we start the bribery at 20 per cent?\=当你完成任务回来时，一位风向督察正对来自伍载镇的船长露出不悦的微笑。\今天早上到期，这些是。如果你不想让你的孩子挨饿，应该坚持你的时间表。他高兴地吮吸着煮熟的甜食。\Shall we start the bribery at 20 per cent?
Adjusting the clock back to Albion Standard Time proves the Windward Company's case. The mob is forced to admit that their hard work was merely an interesting statistical anomaly and disperses, grumbling, to talk of revolutions, walls, and who should be first against the latter once the former begins. Your name comes up more than once in this discussion.=将时钟调回阿尔比恩标准时间证明了Windward公司的情况。暴徒们被迫承认，他们的辛勤工作只是一种有趣的统计学异常现象，然后怨声载道地散去，谈论革命、墙壁，以及一旦前者开始，谁应该首先反对后者。在这种讨论中，你的名字出现了不止一次。
With the clock fixed, a team of cleaners begin scrubbing away the painted protests. They will no doubt be back again soon. Port Prosper is getting large enough to chafe against London's more arbitrary demands, especially ones as inconvenient as an Albion Standard Time that bears no relation to how the people here actually carry out their days.=随着时间的推移，一队清洁工开始擦洗油漆的抗议活动。毫无疑问，他们很快就会再次回来。普罗斯珀港越来越大，足以抵制伦敦更多的任意要求，特别是像阿尔比恩标准时间这样不方便的要求，与这里的人们如何实际度过他们的日子毫无关系。
NatureReserve=自然保护区
Glancing up, a well meaning apprentice sees that technically, the food for the animals has passed its date of best use. He ejects it all into space, not realising that the train carrying replacements is still working to Port Avon time and will not be with the Reserve for at least a couple of weeks. The animals begin baying for their dinner considerably sooner.=瞥了一眼，一个好心的学徒看到，从技术上讲，动物的食物已经过了最佳使用期限。他把这些食物都扔到了太空中，没有意识到运送替代品的火车仍然在阿文港时间工作，至少在几个星期内不会出现在保护区。动物们更早地开始为它们的晚餐欢呼。
Meanwhile, an apprentice finishes a survey and concludes, seeing the same counts doubled, that there are now twice as many animals in the Reserve's care as previously suspected. There is an immediate culling, to avoid over-population. Later, realisation puts a real pall on what is otherwise a quite splendid banquet.=与此同时，一名学徒完成了一项调查，并得出结论，看到同样的计数增加了一倍，现在保护区内的动物数量是以前怀疑的两倍。为了避免人口过剩，立即进行了捕杀。后来，意识到这一点，使本来很丰盛的宴会变得非常苍白。
Out in the reserve, the researchers begin making all sorts of discoveries. A whole family of apparently diurnal owls, for instance. A badger set that can be observed without having to stay up all night in a damp ditch watching badgers conspicuously not doing anything everyone isn't already quite aware that badgers do. \n\nThe mood is quite positive, until someone points out that the animals probably haven't taken note of the recent time change. Torn up notes and aborted monographs flutter from the edges of the reserve.=在保护区内，研究人员开始有了各种发现。例如，一整个家族的猫头鹰显然是昼伏夜出。一个可以观察到的獾群，而不需要整晚呆在潮湿的沟渠里观察獾，明显地不做任何大家还不太了解的獾的事情。\人们的情绪相当积极，直到有人指出，动物们可能没有注意到最近的时间变化。撕毁的纸条和中止的专著从保护区的边缘飘过。
PortAvonIntro=阿文港简介
Wedding bells ring out over Port Avon. The clocks are running fast, not that the happy couple walking towards the church cares.=婚礼的钟声在阿文港上空响起。钟表跑得很快，但走向教堂的幸福夫妇并不在意。
\You here for the clocks?\ The tired looking farmhand rolls his eyes at you. \Couldn't you have been here sooner? Could've had me another couple of hours in bed.\=You here for the clocks? 那个看起来很疲惫的农场主对你翻了个白眼。\你就不能早点来吗？可以让我在床上多躺几个小时。
The port's clock is running eight hours fast. That makes for a whole day's work that, technically, shouldn't have happened.=港口的时钟运行速度是8小时。这使得一整天的工作，从技术上讲，不应该发生。
MagdalenesIntro=MagdalenesIntro
The clocks here all run slightly fast. Clients rarely notice, but over the course of a day it works out to an extra hour's break for their attendants.=这里的时钟都跑得稍快。客户很少注意到，但在一天中，这相当于他们的服务员多休息了一个小时。
Time is running slow here, though that could be the sleepy atmosphere as much as banal matters of clockwork.=这里的时间跑得很慢，虽然这可能是困倦的气氛，也可能是时钟的平庸问题。

The clock is running fast. One of the clients spots you looking at it and grabs your arm. \No,\ she begs, before being dragged away by a pair of expressionless nurses. \No more, please!\=时间过得很快。一个客户发现你在看它，并抓住了你的胳膊。\不，她哀求道，然后被一对面无表情的护士拖走了。\No more, please!
Devils have an infamously loose relationship with conventional time. At Carillon, however, they pay it grudging lip-service.=魔鬼与传统的时间有一种臭名昭著的松散关系。然而，在卡里昂，他们对时间的态度是勉强的。
BrabazonIntro=BrabazonIntro
The clock is fast. Sabotage. Someone has wound it ahead. The culprit soon reveals himself as an exhausted miner. \Please, I've done two shifts already,\ he whispers. \I got to sleep sometime, right?\=时钟很快。破坏。有人把它提前上了发条。罪魁祸首很快暴露了自己是一个疲惫不堪的矿工。\拜托，我已经做了两班了，他低声说。\我总得睡一觉吧？
The overseers look awkward as you approach the clock. By your estimation, they've been slowing them down to extend workers' shifts. Fixing that would give the workers a much needed break.=当你走近时钟时，监督员们显得很尴尬。根据你的估计，他们一直在放慢速度以延长工人的轮班时间。解决这个问题可以让工人们得到急需的休息。
Your guide is a cheerful fellow, oblivious to the fact that the clock is a week slow. \It's my last day here,\ he tells you. \Tomorrow, I go back to London. First thing I'm doing, getting a big steak.\ =你的导游是个开朗的家伙，对时钟慢了一个星期的事实视而不见。\这是我在这里的最后一天，他告诉你。\明天，我将回到伦敦。我做的第一件事就是买一块大牛排。

Festival preparations are in full swing. A glance up at the clock tells you at once that they had better speed up. The three days they think they have left is closer to three hours.=节日的准备工作正在紧锣密鼓地进行。抬头看一眼时钟，你就会知道他们最好加快进度。他们认为剩下的三天时间更接近于三个小时。

You enjoy a pleasant donkey-ride along the shore. The rolling motion of the beast's four unequal legs is soothing, and the complimentary earplugs block out all but their most shrill hunting-screams.=你享受着沿着海岸骑驴的乐趣。野兽的四条不平等的腿的滚动运动很舒缓，而赠送的耳塞除了阻挡它们最尖锐的狩猎尖叫声外，还阻挡了所有的声音。
It takes you a minute but you eventually adapt to your donkey's stilted gait. Halfway through the experience, the beast shucks its limbs, begins undulating smoothly instead along the sand. How fortunate!=你花了一分钟，但你最终适应了驴子的僵硬步态。在经历了一半的时候，这头野兽收起了它的四肢，开始在沙地上平稳地起伏。多么幸运啊！
Your donkey today is uncommonly skittish, spooking at every sound, but at least its distended belly makes for a cushioned ride. If only it could move faster than a crawl.=你的驴子今天异常胆小，一听到声音就会惊慌失措，但至少它膨胀的腹部使骑行变得很有弹性。如果它能比爬行更快就好了。

On the bright side, at least they're quick about the kill.=这次骑驴比其他的更有意义。驴群在岸边发现了一些小东西，而且是断背的。随着一声尖叫，它们向猎物冲去，让你紧紧抓住不放。从好的方面看，至少它们的杀伤力很强。

Tea=茶
Earl Green is the speciality here. Except for a vegetal aftertaste, a radish-y quality, it is mostly inoffensive. The tea room is industrial chic: white marble, black steel. Everyone is silent. Everyone but you is dressed precisely the same way.=绿伯爵是这里的特产。除了一种植物性的回味，一种萝卜味的质量，它大部分是无害的。茶室是工业风格的：白色大理石，黑色钢铁。每个人都沉默不语。除了你之外，每个人都穿得一模一样。
God, this tea is atrocious. It tastes of kelp and salted beef. But the room is warm and there is space to lounge on the sofa which snakes across half the room. =天哪，这茶太难喝了。它有海带和咸牛肉的味道。但房间很暖和，而且有空间可以在沙发上休息，沙发蜿蜒穿过半个房间。
More a seraglio than a tea house, this place is sumptuous, lavish with tissue-thin veils and burgundy carpeting. Your tea is delicate, its flavour impossible to place. The baklava is divine.=与其说这是一家茶馆，不如说是一个妓院，这个地方很奢华，有薄薄的面纱和酒红色的地毯。你的茶很精致，它的味道是无法形容的。焙烤饼是神圣的。
The tea is fragrant and refreshing, with just a kiss of sugar. You see someone attempting to add milk to their tea, and they are summarily lynched by two men who were reading newspapers upside-down.=茶很香，很清爽，只加了一丝糖。你看到有人试图在他们的茶里加牛奶，他们被两个倒着看报纸的人当场处死。

You acquire a lemon meringue tart and some hibiscus tea, both fabulous, and retreat to a plush chair, where you spend the afternoon eavesdropping on a couple discussing their dead friends.=咖啡馆里挤满了衣冠楚楚的老人，他们的衣着古板得不合时宜。你买了一个柠檬酥皮馅饼和一些木槿花茶，这两样东西都很好，然后退到一张长椅上，在那里你花了一个下午的时间偷听一对夫妇讨论他们死去的朋友。

You pick something black and bitter, and take a seat at the table opposite a train's triumphant crew.=在这个低矮的、有蜡烛照明的房间里，除了茶之外什么都不供应，里面充满了檀香和白莲的味道。你挑一些黑色和苦味的东西，在桌子旁坐下来，对面是一列火车的凯旋者。
The tea is dark and unctuous, and is furnished with roots and quite possibly a garnish of dirt. A single sip, however, spreads warmth all the way to your fingertips and toes. Too bad the withdrawal hits harder than the heat.=茶是深色的，不粘稠的，并配有树根和很可能是泥土的装饰品。然而，只要喝一口，温暖就会一直蔓延到你的指尖和脚趾。太糟糕了，退缩的感觉比热量更强烈。
The 'tea' placed in front of you might instead be cooked oatmeal, if not for the stray insect wings and limbs poking out here and there. When you point this out to the waitress, she merely shrugs, and explains that it's a tisane.=摆在你面前的'茶'可能是煮熟的燕麦片，如果不是因为这里和那里探出的流浪昆虫的翅膀和肢体。当你向女服务员指出这一点时，她只是耸耸肩，解释说这是一种茶。
Your tea is tepid, sickly sweet. The room  bare concrete and naked flames  is barren save for muscular men clustered in tense discussion. Broken glass carpets the floor. Perhaps, this wasn't the best choice in eateries.=你的茶是温的，病态的甜。房间里光秃秃的混凝土和赤裸裸的火焰，除了肌肉发达的男人聚集在一起紧张地讨论外，一片荒芜。破碎的玻璃在地板上铺满了地毯。也许，这不是最好的食堂选择。

The baklava is divine, almost as beautiful as the women with their tentacled arms.=与其说这是一个茶馆，不如说是一个蚕室，这个地方很奢华，有薄薄的面纱和酒红色的地毯。你的茶很精致，它的味道是无法形容的。面包糕是神圣的，几乎和那些长着触角的女人一样美丽。
The tea is dark and unctuous, and is furnished with roots and quite possibly a garnish of dirt. A single sip, however, spreads warmth all the way to your fingertips and toes. The air shimmers and suddenly, everyones either lion-headed or crowned with antlers. Too bad the withdrawal hits harder than the heat. =茶是深色的，不粘稠的，并配有树根和很可能是泥土的装饰品。然而，只要喝一口，温暖就会一直蔓延到你的指尖和脚趾。空气中闪闪发光，突然间，每个人要么是狮子头，要么戴着鹿角。太糟糕了，戒断比热度更难打。

Perhaps, this wasn't the best choice in eateries. =你的茶是温的，病态的甜。房间里光秃秃的混凝土和赤裸裸的火焰，除了肌肉发达的男人聚集在一起紧张地讨论外，一片荒芜。碎玻璃在地板上铺满了地毯。也许，这不是最好的选择，在吃的方面。

The 'tea' placed in front of you might instead be cooked oatmeal, if not for the stray insect wings and limbs poking out here and there. When you point this out to the waitress, she merely shrugs, and explains that it's a tisane. =摆在你面前的'茶'可能是煮熟的燕麦片，如果不是这里和那里探出的流浪的昆虫翅膀和肢体的话。当你向女服务员指出这一点时，她只是耸耸肩，并解释说这是一种茶。

The assistant pressures you into ordering today's special: a slice of sesame cake layered with chocolate, and a masala chai. The former's superb, the latter's adequate: it stinks of kava and honeyed wasps. Either way, you regret nothing.=助理给你施加压力，让你点今天的特色菜：一片芝麻蛋糕，上面铺着巧克力，还有一杯玛萨拉茶。前者是极好的，后者是足够的：它有卡瓦和蜜蜂的气味。无论哪种方式，你都不会后悔。

An irregularity in the galley: the table is neatly laid, but the plates are glued in place and the cutlery nailed down.

A crewman is staring fixedly from a stained-glass window. \Look!\ he points out at the apparently ordinary sky. \Webs, strung between the stars! And watch. Watch! There  did you see the stars shiver? Like dew on the cobweb when the spider stirs?\ You saw no such thing.=一个船员正定定地盯着一扇彩色玻璃窗。\看！他指着表面上普通的天空。\网，在星星之间串起！。看着。看！看！看 你看到星星在那里颤抖吗？就像蜘蛛网上的露水被蜘蛛搅动一样？你没有看到这样的事情。
One of your engineers has taken an oath of utter silence. He refuses to speak, or make any sound at all. He has gagged himself, and wrapped rags around his feet to muffle his footsteps. He refuses to employ either wrench or hammer. He is not, as it stands, much use.=你的一个工程师已经发过誓要保持完全的沉默。他拒绝说话，也拒绝发出任何声音。他把自己的嘴堵上，在脚上缠上破布，以压制他的脚步声。他拒绝使用扳手或锤子。就目前的情况来看，他没有什么用处。
A junior signaller is discovered in the hold amidst a pile of dissected books. She is cutting out words and grouping them in clusters to represent a new system of linguistic categorisation. \Narrative is preposterous and occlusive,\ she informs you. \Meaning is the only sensible foundation for classification.\ You examine her arrangements. The words 'light' and 'law' sit side-by-side. Nearby, 'conjunction', 'philosophy' and 'faction'  huddle together.=一名初级信号员在船舱里被发现在一堆被剖开的书中。她正在剪下单词并将它们分组，以代表一种新的语言分类系统。\她告诉你，叙事是荒谬的，是闭塞的。\意义是分类的唯一合理的基础。你检查了她的安排。光 和 法律 这两个词并排在一起。在附近，联合、哲学 和 派别 挤在一起。
You discover a stoker angrily defacing the engine's bible. He claims that here in the heavens, there are more pertinent gods than that of King James. Immediately, he launches into a sermon about the Burrower Below: the wyrm-mother, general-progenitrix of the Devourers of Days, who are called the Aeginae. \She tunnelled the paths across the sky! Every transit is a trespass! We must give praise!\=你发现一个司炉在愤怒地涂抹发动机的圣经。他声称，在这里的天堂，有比詹姆士国王更贴切的神。随即，他开始了关于下面的钻洞者的布道：巫妖之母，被称为Aeginae的日之吞噬者的总祖先。\她在天空中开凿了隧道！每一次过境都是一种侵犯！。每一次过境都是一次闯入！我们必须给予赞美！。We must give praise!
Someone has been making subtle amendments to your Navigator's calculations, presumably in an attempt to alter your course.

She once encountered the Storm that Speaks, and it spoke to her in voices that she had thought she'd never hear again. Ever since, she has been trying to find it once more.=有人一直在对你的导航仪的计算进行微妙的修正，估计是为了改变你的航线。肇事者被发现是一个沉默寡言的工程师。你要求一个解释。她曾经遇到过会说话的风暴，它用她以为再也听不到的声音对她说话。从那时起，她就一直试图再一次找到它。
Dream=梦
You dream of a storm whose lightning scratches words across the sky, and whose thunder is a cacophony of voices belonging to people you have known. Its winds pluck, pitifully, at your clothes. You are wearing black: sombre, funereal black.=你梦见一场风暴，它的闪电在天空中划过文字，它的雷声是属于你所认识的人的声音的杂音。它的风可怜地拨弄着你的衣服。你穿着黑色的衣服：阴沉的、丧气的黑色。
A dream of a midnight meadow. Above you the stars are going out one by one, as if their gas-pipes had been turned off. Flowers bloom in the dark, coloured in a spectrum of blacks that were heretofore imperceptible: the black of grief, the black of before-times, the blacks of liberation and of possibility. A rainbow arches across the newly empty sky, in seven subtle shades. All black, of course.=一个关于午夜草地的梦。在你的上方，星星一个接一个地熄灭，就像它们的煤气管被关掉了一样。花朵在黑暗中绽放，染上了以前无法察觉的黑色光谱：悲痛的黑色，以前的黑色，解放的黑色和可能性的黑色。一道彩虹在新的空旷的天空中拱起，有七个微妙的色调。当然，都是黑色。
The sky of your dream is blazing gold. It is peppered  no, crowded  with suns. Suns piled on suns, like the groats in a miser's hoard.\n\nTheir light floods you. It shines through skin and blood and meat, picking out your branching veins and the slender pillars of your bones. Is there no more to you than this? =你梦中的天空是炽热的金色。它是斑驳的，不，挤满了太阳。太阳堆积在太阳上，就像守财奴囤积的粮食。它们的光芒淹没了你。它穿过皮肤、血液和肉，照亮了你的血管和你骨骼的细长柱子。对你来说，没有比这更多的东西了吗？
You dream of falling. It's a common dream, here. The fogs that bedevil the High Wilderness are thick about you, and through them, below, you see something stir. A beast. A behemoth. Almost a dragon; almost a whale; almost a continent. It gnaws on the roots of heaven, and all the fogs of the Wilderness are its steaming breath. Its maw opens, wide as the gulf between stars.=你梦想着坠落。这是个常见的梦，在这里。困扰高地荒野的大雾在你身边弥漫，透过它们，在下面，你看到有东西在骚动。一头野兽。一个庞然大物。几乎是一条龙；几乎是一条鲸鱼；几乎是一个大陆。它咬着天堂的根，荒野的所有雾气都是它蒸腾的气息。它的大嘴张开，宽如星辰之间的沟壑。
Discontent=不满的情绪
An engineer cries out, her voice hoarse as a professional mourner. \It's gone!\ She points through one of the stained-glass windows. \A star! It winked out!\ You look through the glass. Stars burn upon the firmament. The specific patch of sky she's pointing to is indeed empty, but you couldn't say if a star had been there before.=一个工程师喊道，她的声音嘶哑得像一个职业哀悼者。\It's gone! 她指着其中一扇彩色玻璃窗。\A star! 它眨眼消失了！ 你透过玻璃看。星星在苍穹上燃烧。她所指的那片天空确实是空的，但你不能说以前是否有一颗星星在那里。
A junior signaller receives a dose of medicinal port in the infirmary, after seeing a frozen corpse spin past a window.

As you walk down a crowded thoroughfare, you notice the masked spirits shuffling to one side and dropping reverently to their knees. Some are raising unlit candles; some have retrieved broken hourglasses from their robes. Others are scrawling complex symbols on the floor in chalk.=当你走在拥挤的大道上时，你注意到戴着面具的神灵在一边洗漱，虔诚地跪在地上。一些人正在举起未点燃的蜡烛；一些人从他们的长袍中取出了破碎的沙漏。其他人则用粉笔在地板上涂抹复杂的符号。
You notice that one of the spirits of the dead is lying and convulsing in the gutter. Its porcelain mask is cracked. The other spirits walk swiftly by, not even pausing to glance in its direction.=你注意到，其中一个亡灵躺在水沟里抽搐着。它的瓷质面具已经破裂了。其他亡灵迅速地走过，甚至没有停顿一下，向它的方向看一眼。
As you are making your way along a mean and narrow boulevard, you notice a Weary Spirit hurrying towards you. It clutches a jar containing its voice babbling frantically. =当你沿着一条狭窄的林荫道前进时，你注意到一个疲惫的灵魂匆匆向你走来。它抓着一个装着它的声音的罐子，疯狂地唠叨着。
A servitor is hurrying towards you through a garden. Its robes flap, and its porcelain mask is discommoded. It clutches an array of scrolls: diagrams for a new form of servitor.=一个仆人正穿过花园向你匆匆走来。它的长袍翻飞，它的瓷质面具被弄得乱七八糟。它攥着一排卷轴：一种新形式的仆人的图示。
At the side of the street, trying to stop spirits as they pass, is someone not yet dead, an Antedeceased. He wears a mask, but it is pushed up to his forehead, nose in the air.=在街边，试图在灵魂经过时阻止它们，是一个尚未死亡的人，一个Antedeceased。他戴着面具，但面具被推到了额头上，鼻子在空中。
A crowd of masked spirits passes you: an elephant, a giraffe, two cats, a little boy, and many others. A red string is tied around a limb of each, but a loose end trails from the last creature, a cheetah.=一群戴着面具的灵魂从你身边经过：一头大象、一只长颈鹿、两只猫、一个小男孩，还有许多其他的。一根红绳系在每个人的肢体上，但最后一个生物，一只猎豹，却拖出了一条松散的尾巴。
encounter_text2=遭遇_文本2
The cause of the commotion appears at first glance to be just another spirit in a porcelain mask, taller than the others, his stride more sure. Luminous energies swirl at its feet.=骚动的原因乍一看只是另一个戴着瓷器面具的幽灵，比其他的人更高大，他的步伐更坚定。发光的能量在其脚下旋转。
Noticing your concern, a bureaucrat stops beside you. A voice issues from the jar tucked under its arm. \It has a disease of the soul,\ explains the jar hollowly. \Far rarer than any disease of mind or body, and more difficult to treat. The poor thing will likely unravel soon. Nothing to be done, unless you have something that might strengthen it.\=注意到你的担忧，一个官僚在你身边停下。一个声音从夹在它胳膊下的罐子里发出。\它有一种灵魂上的疾病，罐子空洞地解释道。\比任何精神或身体的疾病都要罕见，而且更难治疗。这个可怜的东西可能很快就会解体。没什么可做的，除非你有可能强化它的东西。
Not far behind it are two dead bureaucrats, citing the Spirit's violations of its status as one of the Yoked. They are gaining on the Spirit, whose jar has now begun to sob hysterically.=在它身后不远处，有两个死掉的官僚，以精神违反了它作为Yoked之一的地位为由。他们正在追赶神灵，神灵的罐子现在已经开始歇斯底里地抽泣。
It stops in front of you. The voice in its jar is scratchy and out of breath. It asks you if you can give it directions to the Forge of Souls.=它在你面前停下。它罐子里的声音很刺耳，而且没有呼吸。它问你，你是否能给它指引去灵魂之炉的方向。
A Yoked spirit follows behind. It is holding the other, broken end of the string, and carrying a goad. Neither is doing it very much good.=一个Yoked精神跟在后面。它拿着绳子的另一端，断了的那一端，并带着一个羊角。两者都对它没有什么好处。
He is pushing a cart marked 'Curios of the Blue Kingdom', made of wood and painted with a design of lotus blossoms. He catches your eye. \Do you have any artworks or masterpieces of the Kingdom I could buy?\=他推着一辆标有'蓝国古玩'的车，是木头做的，上面画着荷花的图案。他吸引了你的目光。\你有什么艺术品或王国的杰作我可以买吗？
Airs of the Blue Kingdom=蓝色王国的空气
CrappyCircus=蹩脚的马戏团
Most of the stalls here are empty, their owners either asleep or long-since gone. You gamely make the most of them, from the Hall of Mirror (there is only one) to the Whack-A-Rat game currently closed due to the rats having unionised. \n\nAt least the day proves quiet, with nothing actively trying to kill you. In the High Wilderness, that alone counts as a vacation.=这里的大部分摊位都是空的，它们的主人不是在睡觉就是早已离开了。你赌气地充分利用它们，从镜子大厅（只有一个）到捶打老鼠的游戏，目前由于老鼠们联合起来而关闭。\至少这一天被证明是安静的，没有什么东西主动想杀你。在高等荒野，光是这一点也算得上是一个假期。
At first glance, the circus is in poor shape. A second glance reveals how much worse things are than that. You try the battered mushrooms, and realise why they have yet to take off as a beloved snack. \n\nAttempting to dispose of the bag, you duck behind a stall and find a pile of them already waiting. Another visitor pokes their head around. \Is this where the bags go?\ she asks and deposits her own with the rest.=乍一看，马戏团的状况很差。再看一眼，就会发现情况比这更糟。你尝了尝糊糊的蘑菇，意识到为什么它们还没有成为人们喜爱的零食。\你想把袋子扔掉，却躲在一个摊位后面，发现有一堆蘑菇已经在等着你了。另一位游客探出头来。\Is this where the bags go? she asks and deposits her own with the rest. 这是袋子去的地方吗？
You spend some time watching the sideshow attractions. The Amazing Invisible Flea Circus is immediately disappointing. The circus' Strong Woman, on the other hand, is arguably too good for the place  effortlessly raising all manner of heavy things over her head. \n\nThe problem is that she makes it look so easy that the audience just shrug. It seems that the only thing she cannot lift is the mood.=你花一些时间观看杂耍景点。惊人的隐形跳蚤马戏团立刻让人失望。另一方面，马戏团的女强人可以说是太出色了，她毫不费力地将各种重物举过头顶。\问题是，她让它看起来如此容易，以至于观众只是耸耸肩。看来，她唯一不能提升的是情绪。
Airs of the Circus=马戏团的空气
Enclave=飞地
An enclave of the dead. These shades  some once human, some not, all masked and quiet  are performing the observances they hope will secure their passage through Death's Door. \n\nThey pray around a pattern of stones arrayed in complex circles. Occasionally, one of them stands and moves a stone, provoking a fierce, but silent and gesticulatory, argument.\n\nWhen you approach, they stop. The laws of guest-right require that they offer you respite.=一个死人的飞地。这些影子有的曾经是人，有的不是人，都戴着面具，安静地表演着他们希望能确保他们通过死亡之门的仪式。\他们围绕着排列成复杂圆圈的石头图案祈祷。偶尔，他们中的一个人站起来移动一块石头，引发一场激烈的、但无声的、打手势的争论。当你走近时，他们停下来。客人权利的法律要求他们为你提供喘息的机会。
An enclave of the dead. These shades are engaged in rites to prepare their passage through Death's Door. They produce slow, ceremonial music with chimes and drums. A handful of them dance ecstatically, their exertions incongruous with the solemn melody.\n\nWhen you approach, they stop. The laws of guest-right require that they offer you respite.=一个死人的飞地。这些阴魂正在举行仪式，准备通过死亡之门。他们用风铃和鼓制造缓慢的仪式性音乐。他们中的一小部分人狂热地跳舞，他们的努力与庄严的旋律不相协调。客人权利的法律要求他们为你提供喘息的机会。
An enclave of the dead is here, where a mix of human and inhuman shades are engaged in a ritual of performative grief. One of them lies on a marble slab while the others claw at the ground, and tear their clothes, and pour dust into the eye-sockets of their masks: all in silence.\n\nWhen you approach, they stop. The laws of guest-right require that they offer you respite.=这里是一块死人的飞地，那里有人类和非人类的混合影子，正在进行表演性的悲伤仪式。其中一个人躺在大理石板上，而其他人则抓着地面，撕扯着衣服，把灰尘倒进他们面具的眼窝里：所有这些都是沉默的。宾客权利法要求他们为你提供喘息的机会。
This is an enclave of the forsaken dead; a gathering of those shades who have failed in their attempts to pass through Death's Door and now linger, with nowhere to go.\n\nThey huddle around the embers of a fire. Some of them rub ash into their skin to feel the memory of warmth.=这是一块被遗弃的死者的飞地；是那些试图通过死亡之门而失败的阴魂的聚集地，他们现在徘徊在这里，无处可去。他们中的一些人将灰烬揉进他们的皮肤，感受温暖的记忆。
Here is an enclave of the forsaken dead  some human, some the spirits of animals  who have fallen between the cracks of the Kingdom's labyrinthine bureaucracy. \n\nTheir masks are smeared with dust. Their limbs are thin as sticks; their eyes avid. They are hungry. Petrichor  the food of the dead  will not suffice, now. Nor will bread or biscuits. They need something hotter.=这里是被遗弃的死者的飞地，有些是人类，有些是动物的灵魂，他们从王国迷宫般的官僚机构的缝隙中掉了出来。\他们的面具上沾满了灰尘。他们的四肢瘦得像棍子；他们的眼睛很热。他们很饿。现在，死人的食物Petrichor是不够的。面包或饼干也不行。他们需要更热的东西。
The dead of this enclave are engaged in an unseemly revel. Though their masks are solemn, their antics are merry. Some dance, or chase each other in sport, or are langourously entangled. All of it takes place in utter silence.\n\nWhen they notice you, some abandon their antics to approach you, curious.=这个飞地的死者正在进行一场不体面的狂欢。虽然他们的面具很庄重，但他们的滑稽动作却很欢快。有些人在跳舞，或在运动中互相追逐，或悠然自得地纠缠在一起。当他们注意到你时，有些人放弃了他们的滑稽动作，好奇地接近你。

a smiling devil, dark-skinned, lounging languidly amidst the roots. He twirls the thorny crown in his fingers. A number of admirers pay him court, hanging on his diabolical wisdoms.=一个微笑的魔鬼，皮肤黝黑，慵懒地躺在树根中。他用手指旋转着带刺的树冠。一些崇拜者向他致敬，挂在他那邪恶的智慧上。
a scarred smuggler with iron-grey hair and a knife in her hands. She has an assessing gaze and an inclination towards unnecessary frankness.=一个伤痕累累的走私者，铁灰色的头发，手里拿着一把刀。她有一种评估的目光，倾向于不必要的坦率。
a proud poet of the Neonocturnal school, who wrote works condemning society's hypocrites. His tongue is barbed, his pen venomous, and his temper as thin as cheesewire.=一个骄傲的新夜郎派诗人，他写的作品谴责社会的伪君子。他的舌头是带刺的，他的笔是有毒的，他的脾气像干酪线一样薄。
none other than January of the revolutionaries' Calendar Council. Ex-academic, anarchist recruiter, lover of crosswords. She wears a mask of two bearded faces: one looking forward, the other backward.=不是别人，是革命者的日历会的一月。前学术界人士，无政府主义者招募者，喜欢猜字谜的人。她戴着一张由两张大胡子组成的面具：一张向前看，另一张向后看。
Airs of the King=国王的空气
Lanes=兰斯
A woman calls you over to a stall selling... Toffee-something. They're a little too large to be apples. She assures you, with a broad smile that \Of course they're apples. Maybe you haven't seen one recently and can't recall how they look?\ Some of the toffee has fingerprints in. Still, that child bedecked in frills seems to be eating some without suffering any obvious harm.=一个女人把你叫到一个卖......太妃糖的摊位前。太妃糖之类的东西。它们有点太大，不像是苹果。她用一个宽厚的笑容向你保证：当然是苹果。也许你最近没有见过，所以想不起它们的样子。有些太妃糖上有指纹。不过，那个身着褶皱的孩子似乎在吃一些，没有受到任何明显的伤害。
This stall has a row of wooden ducks that you can shoot at with an air rifle. A child stands alongside it, crying. He has spent all his money and not knocked down one. When you have a go, it becomes apparent that at least one of the ducks is glued in place. When you point this out, the storekeeper frowns, and hastily passes you a prize.=这个摊位有一排木制鸭子，你可以用气枪射击。一个孩子站在旁边哭泣。他花了所有的钱，却没有打倒一只。当你射击时，你会发现至少有一只鸭子是用胶水粘在那里的。当你指出这一点时，店主皱起眉头，急忙递给你一个奖品。
The frames shop, as it turns out, is not where you purchase corrective glasses. Instead, it hawks poor metaphors and second-rate similes, phrases with which to inadequately frame a situation. Not wanting to be impolite, you buy an analogy for an upset stomach. =事实证明，镜框店不是你购买矫正眼镜的地方。相反，它兜售拙劣的隐喻和二流的比喻，用这些短语来不适当地框定一种情况。你不想无礼，就买了一个胃部不适的比喻。
A macaron store! Delighted, you bustle towards the cramped stall, shouldering past an old man in a top hat. But before you can accost a shopkeeper, you realise they're actually just cardboard cut-outs. Badly painted ones too. How disappointing.,一家马卡龙店！。你高兴地走向狭窄的摊位，从一个戴高帽的老人身边经过。但在你与店主搭讪之前，你意识到他们实际上只是纸板剪影。画得也很差。真让人失望。
An attractive individual, vividly attired in poison colours, draws your attention to a stall. \Bespoke jewellery?\ His cohorts share identical smiles and eyebrows. As one, they gesture at the available material: bits of tinsel, chewed-up bubblegum, bent pennies, bird bones, and strands of hair in every hue. =一个有吸引力的人，身着鲜艳的毒药色，把你的注意力吸引到一个摊位。\Bespoke jewellery?（定制珠宝）。他的同伙有着相同的笑容和眉毛。作为一个整体，他们在现有的材料上做手势：零星的金属丝、嚼碎的泡泡糖、弯曲的硬币、鸟骨和各种颜色的头发丝。
The barber smiles at you with too many teeth. \Shave and a nick?\ he asks. Though his shop is lushly appointed, crushed velvet and a decadently papal aesthetic, it is conspicuously empty. He notes your glance and, crestfallen, offers to sell you a story instead.=理发师用太多的牙齿对你微笑。\他问道：要不要刮刮胡子？虽然他的店面布置得很好，有碎丝绒和一种颓废的教皇式美学，但它明显是空的。他注意到了你的目光，并沮丧地提出要向你推销一个故事。
A macaron store! Delighted, you bustle towards the cramped stall, shouldering past an old man in a top hat. But before you can accost a shopkeeper, you realise they're actually just cardboard cutouts pasted on cheese so old the mould is iridescent. How disappointing. =一家马卡龙店！。欣喜之余，你匆匆走向狭窄的摊位，从一个戴高帽的老人身边走过。但在你和店主搭讪之前，你意识到它们实际上只是贴在奶酪上的纸板剪影，而奶酪的模子已经很旧了，呈彩虹色。真让人失望。
This stall has a row of wooden ducks that you can shoot at with an air rifle. A child stands alongside it, crying. He has spent all his money and not knocked down one. When you have a go, it becomes apparent that at least one of the ducks is glued in place. When you point this out, the storekeeper frowns, and hastily passes you a prize. Behind you, there is the sound of poultry screaming.=这个摊位有一排木制的鸭子，你可以用气枪射击。一个孩子站在旁边，哭了起来。他花了所有的钱，却没有打下一只。当你射击时，你会发现至少有一只鸭子是用胶水粘在那里的。当你指出这一点时，店主皱了皱眉头，匆匆地递给你一个奖品。在你身后，传来了家禽的尖叫声。
The House of Hugh might be a jewellery store, or it may instead be where one purchases men named Hugh. It is hard to say. Inside, it is quiet as a museum and there are gorgeous men relaxing in roped-off areas, drenched in jewellery. It is not worth risking the scandal. You gab with a pink-cheeked mother instead.=休之屋 可能是一家珠宝店，也可能是人们购买名为休的人的地方。这很难说。在里面，它安静得像个博物馆，有一些华丽的男人在有围栏的地方放松，浑身沾满了珠宝。不值得冒着丑闻的风险。你可以和一个粉红脸蛋的母亲聊天。

You gab with a hollow-cheeked mother instead.=休之屋 可能是一家珠宝店，也可能是人们购买名为休的男人的地方。这很难说。在里面，它安静得像个博物馆，有一些华丽的男人在有围栏的地方放松，浑身沾满了珠宝。不值得冒着丑闻的风险。你倒是可以和一个面容空洞的母亲聊聊天。

He notes your glance and, crestfallen, offers to sell you a story instead. =理发师用太多的牙齿向你微笑。\他问道：刮胡子，再加个小胡子？虽然他的店面布置得很好，粉碎的天鹅绒和一种颓废的教皇式美学，但它明显是空的。他注意到了你的目光，然后沮丧地提出要向你推销一个故事。
The frames shop, as it turns out, is not where you purchase corrective glasses. Instead, it hawks poor metaphors and second-rate similes, phrases with which to inadequately frame a situation. Not wanting to be impolite, you buy an analogy for an upset stomach and ignore the way they harvest fresh stock from a gaggle of weeping men.=事实证明，镜框店不是你购买矫正眼镜的地方。相反，它兜售拙劣的隐喻和二流的比喻，用这些短语来不适当地框定一种情况。由于不想失礼，你买了一个胃部不适的比喻，而忽略了他们从一群哭泣的人那里收获新货的方式。

Sobbing can be heard from the direction of the Prince-Consort's tomb. Mourning is a competitive event here.=从亲王墓的方向可以听到啜泣声。哀悼是这里的一项竞争活动。

Footmen move through the shadowed aisles, lighting fresh candles of the finest Chorister wax.=脚夫们在阴影的过道上走来走去，点燃了最好的Chorister蜡的新蜡烛。
Soft laughter comes from a side altar. The ruffle of silk, a sudden giggle, the clatter of a falling reliquary.=柔和的笑声从一旁的祭坛传来。丝绸的褶皱，一个突然的笑声，一个掉落的灵位的咔嚓声。

Dinner=晚餐
The Dismal Chamberlain receives you in a well appointed antechamber. Black candles flicker like failing stars behind the Chamberlain. He serves you a meal from his own kitchens: hand-reared poultry in saffron, roast Chorister, and wine as pallid as the Chamberlain's hand. He eats little but watches you dine with evident satisfaction.=凄惨的张伯伦在一个精心布置的前厅接待你。黑色的蜡烛像衰败的星星一样在张伯伦身后闪烁着。他从自己的厨房里为你准备了一顿饭：藏红花的手工饲养的家禽，烤Chorister，以及像张伯伦的手一样苍白的酒。他吃得很少，但看着你们用餐，显然很满意。
The Macabre Counsellor receives you in a converted chapel off the choir. She rests against a misericord while her sombre-liveried servants wheel in the banquet. This was the feast served at Emperor Nero's funeral apparently: honey and sweetbreads, roast chestnuts and amphora full of wine dark as Eleutheria. She inquires if you've made plans for your own funeral.=恐怖顾问在唱诗班旁边的一个改建的小教堂里接待你。她靠着一个苦行僧休息，而她那身着深色衣服的仆人则在宴席上轮番上阵。这显然是尼禄皇帝葬礼上的盛宴：蜂蜜和甜面包，烤栗子和装满像埃卢瑟亚一样黑的葡萄酒的安瓿瓶。她询问你是否已经为自己的葬礼做了计划。
The Luminous Cardinal has taken over a radial chapel off the Nave to receive you in. It is the Feast of St Blythe, he tells you, or it will be if he's able to send the papers back to the Holy See for canonisation. There is a special liturgy. Afterwards, wiping his mouth of communion wine, he asks for your opinion on the question of revelation, and the division between vision and temptation.=发光的红衣主教已经接管了大殿外的一个放射状小教堂来接待你。他告诉你，今天是圣布莱斯的节日，或者说，如果他能把文件送回罗马教廷加冕的话，就会是这样。有一个特别的礼仪。之后，他擦拭着嘴里的圣餐酒，询问你对启示问题的看法，以及对异象和诱惑的划分。
The Duchess Incarnadine receives you in a private catacomb, where cobwebs festoon the vaults like triumphal banners. She has brought cards, good cheese, and wine. She trounces you thrice at gin rummy while you watch the spiders go to war in the webs. Had she lit a candle flame under them?=因卡纳丁公爵夫人在一个私人墓穴里接待你，那里的蜘蛛网像凯旋的旗帜一样挂满了拱顶。她带来了纸牌、上等奶酪和葡萄酒。她在杜松子酒中打败了你三次，而你却看着蜘蛛在网中打仗。她在它们下面点燃了烛火吗？
The Engraved Mourner has invited you to a feast of all his favourites. You are a motley bunch; you make polite conversation with a deacon and a prospector. The food is unusual; you would never have pared olives with cantankeri, but here you are. The Engraved Mourner watches on, a beatific smile on his sculpted face, as he listens to your conversation.=刻字的送葬者邀请你们参加他所有喜爱的宴会。你们是一群杂牌军；你们与一个执事和一个勘探者进行礼貌的交谈。食物是不寻常的；你不会把橄榄和坎坦凯利放在一起，但你在这里。雕刻的送葬者在一旁看着，他雕刻的脸上带着幸福的微笑，听着你们的谈话。
Dance=跳舞
The Dismal Chamberlain invites you a little soiree in a sepulchral vault above the Nave. Behind a great clockface, a gathering of respectable notables has been assembled. A gallery of musicians plays a selection of Her Renewed Majesty's favourite waltzes. The Dismal Chamberlain is very interested indeed in your opinions on contemporary music.=凄惨的张伯伦邀请你在中殿上方的墓室里举行一个小小的宴会。在一个巨大的钟面后面，有名望的人已经聚集在一起。一群乐师演奏着女王陛下最喜爱的华尔兹舞曲。讨厌的张伯伦对你对当代音乐的看法确实非常感兴趣。
The Luminous Cardinal has organised a dance in the cloister. You are invited. The Cardinal has you waltzing through the cloisters draped in speckled cloaks. It seems he is attempting to recreate the moving Constellations of the Stars. He watches from behind a desk, pausing to sketch something every now and then. Ideas for illuminations, he says later, for his new Bible.=光辉的红衣主教在回廊里组织了一场舞会。你被邀请了。红衣主教让你们披着斑点斗篷在回廊里跳华尔兹。他似乎在试图重现移动的星辰星座。他在一张桌子后面看着，时不时地停下来画一些草图。他后来说，这是为他的新《圣经》提供照明的想法。
The Macabre Counsellor is having some sort of party. Your name is on her list. You are brought to a catacomb the size of a cathedral, where an orchestra is mishandling Saint-Sans. There are costumes. You are made Pope. It emerges the Macabre Counsellor is attempting to recreate a tableaux she once saw in Siena.=恐怖辅导员正在举行某种聚会。你的名字在她的名单上。你被带到一个大教堂般大小的墓穴，那里有一个管弦乐队正在错误地处理圣桑。这里有服装。你被任命为教皇。出现的情况是，马卡博尔顾问试图重现她曾经在锡耶纳看到的一个表象。
The Engraved Mourner invites you to join him and a select few friends in the transept, where there is to be dancing. What transpires is something more akin to musical chairs. \n\nYou and your partner will begin the waltz only for the Mourner to call a sudden halt, silencing the beleaguered fiddler. Then he will produce his sketchbook and spend several minutes detailing your form, caught in the middle of your move. And then repeat. It is a trying if athletically stimulating evening.=雕刻的送葬者邀请你加入他和少数几个朋友在中庭的行列，那里将有舞蹈。结果是更类似于音乐椅的东西。\你和你的伙伴将开始跳华尔兹，但送葬者会突然叫停，让陷入困境的小提琴手闭嘴。然后他将拿出他的素描本，花几分钟的时间详细描述你的形式，在你的动作中被抓住。然后再重复。这是一个考验人的夜晚，如果在运动方面有刺激的话。
The Duchess Incarnadine has invited you to a dance in the Nave. Pews and candlesticks have all been cleared away to make space for the dancing. You are given a comfortable dinner suit, a helmet, and padded gloves. \n\nTheir necessity soon becomes apparent. The Duchess has devised an exotic new dance, combining elements of the waltz, the joust and something called 'shinty.' You acquit yourself admirably, and a doctor is on hand for the worst of it.=因卡纳丁公爵夫人邀请您参加在中殿举行的舞会。座位和烛台都已经被清理掉了，以便为舞蹈腾出空间。你会得到一套舒适的晚宴服、一个头盔和加垫手套。\它们的必要性很快就显现出来。公爵夫人设计了一种异国情调的新舞蹈，结合了华尔兹、比武和一种叫做 闪电 的元素。你的表现令人钦佩，最糟糕的情况下有医生在旁边。

The faded portrait of the Unseen Queen now hangs in the corridor just outside your quarters. The crew still don't quite understand your ambitions, and resent the portrait for both suspicious and superstitious reasons.\n\n\What do you have to tell me?\ asks the Queen sharply as you approach. You suspect she misses her moonlit court.=褪色的隐世女王的画像现在就挂在你宿舍外的走廊上。船员们仍然不太理解你的雄心壮志，并且因为可疑和迷信的原因而对这幅画像感到不满。你有什么要告诉我的？当你走近时，女王急切地问道。你怀疑她怀念她的月光法庭。
The faded portrait of the Unseen Queen still hangs in the corridor just outside your quarters. \n\nShe is now depicted holding a stone goblet in one elegant hand. Her face, as ever, is scratched beyond recognition.=看不见的女王的褪色画像仍然挂在你住所外的走廊上。\她现在被描绘成用一只优雅的手拿着一个石杯。她的脸，和以前一样，被刮得面目全非。

\Are you ready to experience the last moments of my father?\ asks the Unseen Queen. \n\nYour chosen vessel nods solemnly, approaching the Cup. Tendrils of light dance across their brow.=你准备好体验我父亲的最后时刻了吗？看不见的女王问道。\你选择的容器郑重地点点头，走近杯子。光的卷轴在他们的眉宇间舞动。
As the poisoned words take effect, the souls within the Cup whirl faster. A pillar of lightning roars from the Cup and cuts the sky in two.\n\nToo late, the Storm That Speaks takes notice of you. Too late, the voices on the wind start to shriek.\n\nThe Queen takes a step forward (now fully escaped from her frame). \You erased me from time, father. But not thoroughly enough. A vestige remained. A painting.\=随着毒言的生效，圣杯内的灵魂加速旋转。一道闪电柱从圣杯中咆哮而出，将天空一分为二。太晚了，说话的风暴注意到了你。Too late, the voices on the wind start to shriek.The Queen takes a step forward (now fully escaped from her frame). \你把我从时间中抹去了，父亲。但还不够彻底。一个遗迹仍然存在。一幅画。
The Storm falls ominously quiet. \n\n\I promised that after you found the Cup you would have immortality,\ says the Unseen Queen. She is a giantess now, with quicksilver skin. \I didn't say how soon.\n\n\First, of course, I will have to destroy the Blue Kingdom and usurp the throne of the Sapphir'd King. When I have done so, your entire species will be immortal. That is my promise.\=风暴 不祥地安静下来。\我承诺在你找到圣杯之后，你将拥有不朽的生命，看不见的女王说。她现在是一个女巨人，有着流银般的皮肤。\我没有说多长时间。当然，首先，我必须摧毁蓝色王国，并篡夺Sapphir'd国王的王位。当我这样做的时候，你们整个物种都将是不朽的。这是我的承诺。
The Queen stares down at you in horror. The moon vanishes from the sky, and you find yourself back beneath the gathering storm.\n\n\Why  why would you\ The Unseen Queen is fading. The very fact of her existence is still too fragile to cope with the Minute to Midnight's onslaught of weaponised time.\n\nAs she convulses, the Storm That Speaks swells, gathers strength. It seems it wasn't quite yet destroyed; and now it senses weakness in its would-be conqueror.=女王惊恐地盯着你。月亮从天空中消失了，你发现自己又回到了正在聚集的风暴之下。Why why would you\ 看不见的女王正在消逝。她存在的事实仍然太脆弱，无法应对 午夜一分钟 的武器化时间的冲击。随着她的抽搐，说话的风暴 膨胀起来，聚集了力量。似乎它还没有完全被摧毁；而现在它感觉到了它的潜在征服者的弱点。
The Unseen Queen is ascending to the sky and donning the flayed ghost of her father's torment. A crown of lightning has begun to dance across her brow; a robe of roiling clouds is wrapping her in an embrace. With each passing second, she strengthens her claim on existence. Soon, Albion will have a moon again.=看不见的女王正在升上天空，戴上她父亲折磨的剥皮鬼。一顶闪电的冠冕已经开始在她的眉间舞动；一件咆哮的云朵的袍子正将她包裹在一个怀抱中。每过一秒，她都会加强她对存在的要求。很快，阿尔比恩将再次拥有一个月亮。

As you walk into the antechamber, you hear the tolling of a distant bell. The ceiling erupts into flame, and a wall of horizontal fire descends upon you with unstoppable finality.=当你走进前厅时，你听到了远处钟声的响起。天花板爆发出火焰，一堵水平的火墙以不可阻挡的最终方式降临在你身上。
The vault is truly vast, larger than any cathedral you've seen. Every inch is stacked with glittering treasures and dusty relics. \n\n\There,\ says the Queen.\n\nIn pride of the place at the vault's centre is the Martyr-King's Cup. \n\nIt is not a mere cup, of course. It is a whirling, spitting, shimmering vortex, flashing with lightning and fire, as wide and deep as a well.\n\nHow can you possibly take this back to the engine?=金库确实很大，比你见过的任何大教堂都大。每一英寸都堆满了闪闪发光的宝物和尘封的遗物。\皇后说：在那里，在金库的中心，有一个值得骄傲的地方，那就是殉道者-国王的杯子。\当然，这不是一个简单的杯子。它是一个旋转的、喷吐的、闪闪发光的漩涡，闪烁着闪电和火焰，像井一样宽阔和深邃。你怎么可能把这个带回引擎？
The moonlight fades, and you find yourself back in the vault. \n\nThe swirling pit at the vault's centre has vanished; and when you examine the portrait of the Unseen Queen, you realise she is now holding a stone cup in her hands. Her face is mostly scratched out still, but you think you can perceive a smile.\n\nBefore you can question her, a distant bell begins tolling rather urgently.=月光褪去，你发现自己回到了保险库。\金库中心的漩涡已经消失了；当你检查看不见的女王的画像时，你发现她现在手里拿着一个石杯。她的脸大部分都被刮掉了，但你认为你能感知到她的微笑。在你能询问她之前，远处的钟声开始急促地响起。
journal_description=日记_描述
The Journal is a fascinating but frustrating document, written in both terrible handwriting and a near-impenetrable code. Much of what you can painstakingly decipher is meaningless without context. Scattered phrases like 'chimeric moonlight', 'a Golden Day', and 'death in amber'. Most of all, that same alluring phrase again and again: 'The Martyr-King's Cup.' \n\nYou study it through the night. You feel on the verge of a tantalising realisation.=这本日记是一份迷人但令人沮丧的文件，是用可怕的笔迹和几乎无法破解的密码写的。你费尽心思破译的大部分内容在没有上下文的情况下是毫无意义的。散落的短语如 嵌合月光、金色的一天 和 琥珀中的死亡。最重要的是，那个同样诱人的短语一次又一次地出现：殉道者-国王之杯。\你彻夜研究它。你觉得自己正处于一个诱人的实现的边缘。
With the journal finally cracked, you sit back, bleary-eyed. You realise that you've been working for almost two days without food or sleep.=日记终于被破解了，你坐下来，眼冒金星。你意识到，你已经工作了近两天，没有食物和睡眠。

decision_description=决定_描述
Are you going to speak the secrets you've learned, even those that anger the powerful? Or will you keep silent?=你是要说出你所学到的秘密，甚至是那些激怒强者的秘密？或者你会保持沉默？
Are you going to encourage other would-be explorers to follow in your footsteps?=你是否要鼓励其他有志于探险的人跟随你的脚步？
You write until you need to sleep. Then you sleep until you need to write. When you resurface, the first canto is complete. What now? You've not nearly finished the Song, not yet. But perhaps you've written enough to show to a publisher.=你写作直到你需要睡觉。然后你睡觉，直到你需要写作。当你重新出现时，第一部大部头已经完成。现在呢？你还没有几乎完成这首歌，还没有。但也许你已经写得够多了，可以给出版商看。
Are you writing about a fictional character, merely drawing inspiration from your own experiences, or are you writing an explicit memoir?=你是在写一个虚构的人物，只是从你自己的经历中汲取灵感，还是在写一本明确的回忆录？
There are many ways to tell a tale. Are you writing dry journalism with a hint of dark humour? A page-turner with bounding, scintillating prose? Or yearning verse, tinged with melancholy?=讲述故事的方式有很多。你是在写带有一丝黑色幽默的干巴巴的新闻？是用跳跃的、令人激动的散文来翻阅一页？还是带有忧郁色彩的渴望的诗篇？
When you take the Second Canto to the Omnivorous Publisher, he flashes a goblin-like grin. \We're going to set this city on fire,\ he declares with convincing menace.=当你把第二部大部头拿给全能的出版商时，他闪过一个妖精般的笑容。\他以令人信服的威胁宣称：我们要把这个城市烧掉。
When you take the Third Canto to the Omnivorous Publisher, he scans it with an empty grin before handing it to one of his assistants (how long has he had assistants?). \Another masterpiece,\ he says. \You never cease to amaze.\=当你把《第三章》拿给全能出版商时，他空笑着扫了一眼，然后把它递给他的一个助手（他有助手多久了？） \他说：又是一部杰作。\你从来没有停止过惊奇。
Are you depicting your actions as purely heroic, or are you going to be honest?=你是把你的行为描绘成纯粹的英雄主义，还是要诚实？
The Omnivorous Publisher puffs his cigar and holds your manuscript up to the light. A jewelled watch sparkles on his wrist (how long has he had that?). \You should celebrate tonight,\ he says, pouring you a generous helping of whiskey. \Then I want you to go straight home and start the next one. No detours.\=全能的出版商抽着雪茄，把你的手稿举到灯光下。他手腕上的珠宝手表闪闪发光（他有多长时间了？） \他说：你今晚应该庆祝一下，他给你倒了一杯丰盛的威士忌。\然后我希望你直接回家，开始下一个项目。不要走弯路。
You find the Omnivorous Publisher at his paper-drowned desk, flanked by two large gentlemen with shoulders wide as anvils and guns at their hips. \Protection,\ explains the Publisher, tossing back a glass of whiskey. \Some of your readers are rather... fanatical.\ He briefly skims your manuscript before handing it to an assistant. =你发现全能发行人在他那张被纸淹没的桌子旁，两边是两个肩膀宽如铁砧、腰间有枪的大块头。\发行人解释说：保护，他把一杯威士忌酒扔了回去。\你的一些读者是相当......狂热的。他简要地浏览了你的手稿，然后把它交给了一个助手。
The Omnivorous Publisher sends a lackey to collect your manuscript. \The Publisher is attending some very important parties, promoting your work,\ says the assistant, tucking the Sixth Canto beneath her arm without reading it. \He sends his apologies.\=全能的出版商派了一个仆人来取你的手稿。\助理说：出版商正在参加一些非常重要的聚会，为你的作品做宣传，她说，把第六卷书塞在胳膊下面，没有看。\他向你表示歉意。
Your attempts to capture the sky in words have tended to return, again and again, to a similar theme:=你试图用文字来捕捉天空，往往会一次又一次地回到一个类似的主题：
Perhaps now is the time to tell their stories in more detail? Or are they just going to remain your supporting cast?=也许现在是时候更详细地讲述他们的故事了？或者他们只是要继续做你的配角？
You instruct your assistant to begin printing a collected edition of all seven Cantos. The Song of the Sky is complete, and with it, your legacy assured.=你指示你的助手开始印刷所有七部大部头的合订本。天空之歌》已经完成，你的遗产也随之得到保证。
writing_description=写作_描述
At first each word must be individually wrestled from your recalcitrant mind, and somewhere between brain and paper they lose their lustre. Finally, just as the mountain of crumpled paper beside your desk has reached your knees, you strike something. A match, a vein, a melancholy chord.=起初，每一个字都必须从你顽固的头脑中单独抓出来，在大脑和纸张之间，它们失去了光泽。最后，就在你桌子旁边的皱巴巴的纸张堆积到你的膝盖时，你发现了什么。一根火柴，一条静脉，一个忧郁的和弦。
Before you can truly begin the Song of the Sky, you must make a decision:=在你能真正开始《天空之歌》之前，你必须做出决定：
A pause in your fevered typing. Before you write any further, you must make a decision:=在你狂热的打字中暂停一下。在你继续写下去之前，你必须做一个决定：
You stare at the half-empty page in panic. For a moment, you fear you've lost your terrible momentum. But then the story catches you in its arms again, and you are a golem, a conduit, a ghost desperate to relay its final message. You write until your fingers are blistered, until the ending catches you by surprise. You recline, sweat-drenched. The Third Canto is complete.=你惊恐地盯着那张半空的纸。有那么一刻，你担心你失去了可怕的动力。但是，故事又把你抓在怀里，而你是一个傀儡，一个管道，一个急于转达其最后信息的幽灵。你一直写到手指起泡，直到结局让你大吃一惊。你躺下，汗流浃背。第三部经文完成了。
Themes that had once lurked in the recesses of your mind now rise unbidden to the surface, shaking the last vestiges of your subconscious from their flanks. You finally get the sense that you know what you're doing, and more importantly, where you're going. You sit to write, fingers flying, that shining spectre of an ending blazing like a beacon in your head... until finally, you reach it. The Fourth Canto is complete.=曾经潜伏在你心灵深处的主题现在不由自主地浮出水面，把你的潜意识的最后残余从侧面摇醒。你终于感觉到，你知道自己在做什么，更重要的是，你要去哪里。你坐下来写作，手指飞舞，那个闪亮的结局的幽灵像灯塔一样在你的脑海中闪耀......直到最后，你达到了它。第四卷完成了。
Before you launch yourself into writing the Song of the Sky, you re-read the previous three Cantos. You're surprised to find that its ethos, its purpose, are taking shape with a clarity you hadn't noticed or planned.=在你开始写《天空之歌》之前，你重新阅读了之前的三部大作。你惊讶地发现，它的精神、它的目的，正以一种你没有注意到或没有计划到的清晰的方式形成。
As you write, words coming unbidden, you realise that you're about to launch into an anecdote that could destroy some formidable reputations. The words squirm in your head, anxious to make it to the page. You must make a decision:=当你写作时，文字不由自主地出现了，你意识到你即将发起一个轶事，可能会破坏一些强大的声誉。这些文字在你的脑海中蠕动，急于将其写在纸上。你必须做出决定：
As you contemplate the blank page, awaiting inspiration, you realise that throughout the course of the Song you've written of your crew only when necessary. =当你沉思着空白的一页，等待着灵感时，你意识到在整个宋的过程中，你只在必要时才写你的船员。
You return to your office and write. It's as easy as breathing. The Song of the Sky was a tangled beast at times, but you always knew how it would end, and for once it doesn't surprise you. You get there in no time at all. The Seventh Canto is complete, and you have a final decision to make:=你回到你的办公室，开始写作。这就像呼吸一样容易。天空之歌》有时是一头纠结的野兽，但你总是知道它将如何结束，而且这一次它没有让你感到惊讶。你很快就会到达那里。第七部《天歌》已经完成，你有一个最后的决定要做：
You finish writing the postscript and tear off the final page of the Song of the Sky. Your typewriter immediately falls apart in a clatter of exhausted metal. You rather feel like following suit.=你写完后记，撕下《天空之歌》的最后一页。你的打字机立即在一片疲惫的金属声中散架。你颇有效仿的感觉。
Words spit like lightning from your fingertips. The typewriter shudders and clanks in protest under the strain. You write in a kind of fury, your mind's eye raging with images of gloating stars and endless burning emptiness  and then you sit back, exhausted, as you realise you've run out of words. The Second Canto is complete.=话语像闪电一样从你的指尖吐出。打字机在压力下颤抖并发出叮当声以示抗议。你在一种愤怒中写作，你的脑海中充斥着幸灾乐祸的星星和无尽燃烧的空虚的图像，然后你疲惫地坐下来，因为你意识到你已经没有字了。第二章已经完成。
The tale has grown in the telling, and grown, and grown. In its vastness, it has become impossible to control. You find yourself searching through previous Cantos to ensure consistency of character and detail  stumbling unexpectedly upon narrative dead ends  writing yourself into terrible tangles that cannot be salvaged. With the grim determination of Hercules facing the hydra, you cut. And cut. Until the story lies bleeding, but better, at your feet. The Fifth Canto is complete.=这个故事在讲述中不断成长，不断成长，不断成长。在它的浩瀚中，它已变得无法控制。你发现自己在之前的几部作品中寻找，以确保人物和细节的一致性，却意外地在叙述的死胡同里跌倒，把自己写进了无法挽回的可怕纠结中。带着海格力斯面对九头蛇的严峻决心，你剪了。不断地删减。直到故事躺在你的脚下，流血不止，但更好。第五章已经完成。
A moment of hesitation, and then a dam bursts in your mind. Words flood the page and carry you forward in an irresistible current, until you are flung into an ending as though dashed upon rocks. The result is rushed and imperfect. Grimly, you go back. You knock the story down and rebuild it, brick by painstaking brick, working with the nihilist fury of a master blacksmith forging his own guillotine. Finally, just as you are ready to throw your entire manuscript into the fire, you realise that you no longer need to  there's nothing left to fix. The Sixth Canto is complete.=犹豫片刻，然后你心中的大坝就破裂了。文字充斥着页面，在不可抗拒的水流中带着你前进，直到你被抛向一个结局，就像被冲到岩石上。结果是仓促和不完美的。严峻的是，你回去了。你把故事推倒重建，一砖一瓦地努力工作，像铁匠师傅锻造自己的断头台一样虚无主义的愤怒。最后，就在你准备把你的整个手稿扔进火里的时候，你意识到你不再需要这样做了，没有什么可以修复了。第六章已经完成。

You return to your waiting. You have read all your books, now. You have listened to your handful of phonograph cylinders. You consider learning the oboe, which you bought in a fit of optimism when furnishing the Gallery.\n\nOutside, thirty more years hurry by. There is a second knock at the door. =你回到了你的等待中。你已经读完了你所有的书，现在。你已经听完了你的几张留声机唱片。你考虑学习双簧管，这是你在布置画廊时乐观地买下的。在外面，又有30年匆匆而过。敲门声再次响起。

${Crossing=${十字路口
Crossing=十字路口
A few stones are speckled across a laughing stream. Getting across involves much flailing of limbs and the occasional undignified leap. Trouble occurs half-way across where a stone has clearly shifted in a recent storm. Your tallest crewman is required to serve as a bridge.=几块石头斑斑点点地横在一条欢笑的小溪上。过河涉及到很多四肢的摆动和偶尔的不体面的跳跃。问题出现在半路上，一块石头显然在最近的风暴中移位了。你们最高的船员需要充当桥梁。
A bridge lies broken in the river. Bridge is perhaps a loose term. Brunel never cast his eye over this sorry assortment of slabs. They shift and creak in the water, and one crewman is almost lost to sudden concussion.=一座桥断在河里。桥梁也许是一个宽泛的术语。布鲁内尔从来没有把他的目光投向这些可怜的石板。它们在水中晃动，吱吱作响，一个船员几乎因突然的脑震荡而丧生。
A bridge, such as chariots might have thundered over, once stood here, though only pillars remain. Navigating those requires sudden feats of athleticism and fervent prayers to the prevailing wind. This place was once tamed, but now runs wild.=这里曾经有一座桥，就像战车在上面打雷一样，不过现在只剩下柱子。驾驭这些桥需要突然的运动能力和对盛行风的热切祈祷。这个地方曾经被驯服，但现在却在狂奔。
Picnic=野餐
You ford a steep hill and find the Feckless Theologian and the Dismal Paleographer sharing a bottle of brandy at the summit. The Paleographer twines flowers in his hair, while the Theologian corrects him: Violets, never roses. And never, ever ever, lilies. There, I look half Elagabalus already. They do not bother to notice you, lost in quiet bickering.=你穿过一座陡峭的山丘，发现无用神学家和糟糕的苍老师在山顶分享一瓶白兰地。苍老师在他的头发上缠绕着鲜花，而神学家则纠正他。是紫罗兰，不是玫瑰。还有，永远不要，永远不要，百合花。在那里，我看起来已经有一半的埃拉加巴卢斯了。他们懒得注意你，沉浸在安静的争吵中。
The Feckless Theologian is lying in the Vituperative Classicists lap. She reads out her favourite passages from Virgil, in between swigs from a large amphora. The Theologian drinks even more fervently, as he laments the poets treatment of Turnus. The discussion soon turns to debate, and then disappointment, as the Classicist storms away. Neither notices you, lost in wine and vitriol.=无用神学家 正躺在 蔑视古典主义者 的腿上。她读出了她最喜欢的维吉尔的段落，其间用大酒瓶喝了几口。神学家喝得更欢了，他感叹诗人对特努斯的处理。讨论很快变成了辩论，然后是失望，因为古典主义者冲了出去。两人都没有注意到你，在酒和谩骂中迷失了方向。
The Dismal Paleographer and the Vituperative Classicist are sat over a book of sketches. They share a flask of some amber liquid, passing it between them. This is of you, I think. I always thought it was you; he always represented you as a hawk. And you a swallow. He preferred eagles. They lapse into silence, either not seeing or ignoring you.=忧郁的古文字学家和愤怒的古典主义者坐在一本素描书旁。他们共用一壶琥珀色的液体，在他们之间传递。这是你的作品，我想。我一直认为这是你；他总是把你画成一只鹰。而你是一只燕子。他更喜欢老鹰。他们陷入了沉默，要么没有看到你，要么忽视了你。
The remnant of a picnic basket sits empty in the pouring rain. Empty glasses fill with water. A plate is washed away.=野餐篮子的残余物在大雨中空荡荡地坐着。空杯子里装满了水。一个盘子被冲走了。
Lost=迷失
Youre able to find your way to a steep hill, covered in an avalanche of leaves. You pull your way to the top, and the way ahead is clear, just a few miles to the south. The shadow of the barrow falls over you.=你能够找到你的路，来到一个陡峭的山头，被雪崩般的树叶覆盖。你把路拉到山顶，前面的路很清楚，就在南边的几英里处。荒冢的阴影落在你身上。
You have to go back. You ignore all complaints, doubts, and shrieks of anguish. Back across that river, right at the dead yew, thrice up the hill when you thought you were lost again. But - at last - the trail you were following is before you once more. The fires of the camp are very far away.=你必须回去。你不理会所有的抱怨、怀疑和痛苦的嘶吼。回到那条河对面，就在那片枯萎的紫杉树下，三次上山，当时你以为你又迷路了。但是--最后--你所追随的足迹再次出现在你面前。营地的火堆非常遥远。
The shadows of the trees fall all around you. Twigs snap under your feet as you make your way on, almost blind through the dark. The lighting of a lantern almost starts a fire. An unexpected pond ruins boots and morale. Something lows in the copse just beside you. But  eventually  you find your way to a familiar spot.=树的影子落在你周围。当你在黑暗中几乎盲目地前进时，树枝在你的脚下折断。点燃的灯笼几乎引发了一场火灾。一个意外的水塘毁了靴子和士气。在你身边的灌木丛中，有什么东西倒下了。但最终你还是找到了你的路，来到了一个熟悉的地方。
You cant even hear your crew. Alone in the dark of the wood. Neither sign nor compass to guide your way. You fumble through the blind wood for what seems hours. Every time you look behind, all signs of your passage have seemingly vanished, swept away. Could you find your way back? And then, like the rising of the first star in the evening, you find yourself in a wooded glade. Your crew is waiting. All speak of eery trails and sudden silences opening before them.=你甚至听不到你的船员。独自一人在黑暗的树林里。既没有标志，也没有指南针为你指路。你在盲目的树林中摸索了好几个小时。每当你往后看时，所有你通过的迹象似乎都消失了，一扫而空。你能找到回去的路吗？然后，就像夜晚第一颗星星的升起一样，你发现自己在一片树林里。你的船员正在等待。所有的人都在说他们面前出现了可怕的小路和突然的寂静。
Glade=小树林
The little glade is marshy and wets your boots, yet affords a quick short-cut through the high birches on either side. A babbling brook cutting through the middle affords you the change to slake your thirsts.=这片小树林是沼泽地，弄湿了你的靴子，但却提供了一条穿过两边高大白桦树的快速捷径。一条潺潺的小溪从中间穿过，为你提供了解渴的机会。
The forest opens onto a large grove, where great hagwood trees vye with storm ashes for dominion of the skies. Someone has attempted to cultivate beds of flowers here, once long ago. Wildflowers now run wild in the deep hollows of the grove.=森林通向一个大树林，那里有巨大的哈格伍德树与风暴灰烬争夺天空的统治权。很久以前，有人曾试图在这里开垦花圃。现在野花在小树林的深凹处疯长。
The glade is more of a valley, which chases a river that courses laughing through the wild of the wood. Two lines of bronzewood trees mighty and terrible form the spine of the glade, like the pillars of a cathedral.=这个小树林更像是一个山谷，它追逐着一条河流，在树林的野外欢笑着流淌。两行强大而可怕的铜钱树构成了丛林的脊柱，就像大教堂的柱子。
The glade is as deep and dark as the bottom of a well. Fireflies guide your way through the hollows and hidden places contained therein. At one point, the path narrows so tightly that you are forced to go two by two through the dark.=丛林就像井底一样深邃和黑暗。萤火虫引导你穿过其中的空洞和隐藏的地方。在某一点上，道路变得如此狭窄，以至于你不得不两个人一起穿过黑暗。

My theory isnt developing as well as Id like. So many legends speak of Charlemagne departing his castle for a deep well, to there sit until the end of days. His beard grows strong and long, his golden sceptre in his hand, his golden crown on his head. They disagree on the location, however. But if this is not the end of days, what is?=我的理论并没有像我想的那样发展得很好。许多传说都提到查理曼大帝离开他的城堡去了一口深井，在那里坐到天荒地老。他的胡子长得又长又壮，手里拿着金色的权杖，头上戴着金色的皇冠。然而，他们对地点有不同意见。但如果这不是末日，那什么才是？
The evidence weve uncovered, while not conclusive, certainly points to a monarch in the early medieval style. His accoutrements classical, his lifestyle and habits decidedly Germanic. Conclusive proof is required, however, before I can justify going to the tomb itself.=我们所发现的证据，虽然不是决定性的，但肯定指向一个中世纪早期风格的君主。他的装备是古典的，他的生活方式和习惯明显是日耳曼式的。然而，在我能够证明进入墓穴之前，还需要确凿的证据。

Result=结果
\They are dreaming of you. They Who Must Grieve whisper to me in my sleep of your face, the lines of your throat and nose. They tell me things of you that I do not understand.\ The Bedraggled Parson's regard burns like sepsis, abyss-deep and incurious.=他们正在梦到你。他们在睡梦中对我轻声说起你的脸，你的喉咙和鼻子的线条。他们告诉我关于你的事情，我不明白。衣衫褴褛的牧师的视线像败血症一样燃烧着，深不见底，无动于衷。
\We ignore our dreams too easily,\ says the Bedraggled Parson, eyes abstract, fixed on a sky obscured by sinew. \We pretend that they are nothing but the brain misfiring, that they are memories poorly assembled. But they are more. They are how the gods speak to us. And They Who Must Grieve, they've sent me signs.\ \n\nHe is not talking with you, but at you. Does he care that he's near-incomprehensible? His followers nod, entranced. They understand, or do not care that they don't.=We ignore our dreams too easily, said the Bedraggled Parson, eyes abstract, fixed on a sky obscured by sinew. \我们假装它们只不过是大脑的失灵，它们是组装得不好的记忆。但它们更多。它们是诸神对我们说话的方式。而那些必须悲伤的人，他们已经向我发出了信号。 \他不是在和你说话，而是在和你说话。他在乎自己近乎不可理喻吗？他的追随者们点头，陶醉其中。他们理解，或者不在乎他们不理解。
\We understand that it can feel demeaning.\ When he speaks, it is with the resonance of a choir, symphonic and strange. \To do such... menial things. But they are necessary. As breathing is necessary, as light, as air.\\n\nHe seems to be acknowledging the tasks he asks of you. This is almost certainly no indication that he intends to remunerate you suitably.=我们理解，这可能会让人觉得很没面子。 当他说话的时候，就像一个合唱团的共鸣，交响乐的和奇怪的。\做这种......琐碎的事情。但它们是必要的。就像呼吸是必要的，就像光，就像空气。他似乎在承认他要求你做的事情。这几乎可以肯定地表明，他并不打算给你适当的报酬。
\Strangers, sour-faced, sour-mouthed, have begun to fill the Off Season. Is this your doing? If so, thank you.\ The Bedraggled Parson slants a heavy-lashed stare. \n\nThat certainly sounds like the Displeased you encountered in the Avid Horizon. What ship brought them here so swiftly?=陌生人，脸色苍白，嘴角上扬，已经开始充斥着淡季。这是你做的吗？如果是的话，谢谢你。衣衫褴褛的牧师斜着眼睛看了一眼。\这听起来确实像你在 渴求之地平线 号上遇到的不高兴者。什么船把他们如此迅速地带到这里？
\Do not keep them waiting.\ The Bedraggled Parson sways his head to a music only he can hear, a mourner in the throes of a dirge. \You must descend to them.\\n\nHis encouragement is gentle, but consistent. He knows you will go into the mists eventually. It's just a matter of time.=不要让他们等待。 衣衫褴褛的牧师在只有他能听到的音乐中摇头晃脑，就像一个哀悼者在唱着哀歌。\他的鼓励是温和的，但也是一致的。他知道你最终会进入迷雾之中。这只是一个时间问题。
\Some of them may resist, but it is only because they are afraid. Change is not intrinsic to human nature.\ The Bedraggled Parson bobs his head, mouth pinched to a gash. Surely he'd only desire new parishioners who want to be there?=他们中的一些人可能会抵制，但这只是因为他们害怕。变化并不是人类本性所固有的。衣衫褴褛的牧师晃了晃脑袋，嘴巴被捏成了一个缺口。当然，他只希望新的教区居民愿意去那里？
\I hear them in my sleep, in the Mists, in the murmur of the On Season as they laugh, glass in their throats. They are crying out for change, for the world to shift. Tell me you've found them.\ The Bedraggled Parson warbles. \Tell me you've shown them a way home.\ \n\nIt seems his concern for potential new parishioners goes further than merely increasing the number of his followers.=我在睡梦中听到他们的声音，在迷雾中，在安季的杂音中，当他们笑的时候，玻璃在他们的喉咙里。他们在呼唤改变，呼唤世界的转变。告诉我你已经找到了他们。衣衫褴褛的牧师大声说。\Tell me you've shown them a way home. 告诉我你已经给他们指出了一条回家的路。 \似乎他对潜在的新教友的关注比仅仅增加他的追随者的数量更进一步。
\Aaaah.\ There is a new light to his fever-burnished stare, a hunger, deep as the throat of the sea. \We are rejuvenated. When I sleep, there is another edge to their songs, something better than before.\\n\nYou could not have cheered the Scorn Fluke. Could not have saved it. But it got something of value from you, and the parson knows this.=Aaaah. 他发烧的眼睛里有一种新的光芒，一种饥饿感，像大海的喉咙一样深。\We are rejuvenated. 当我睡觉时，他们的歌声里有另一种优势，比以前更好的东西。不可能拯救它。但它从你那里得到了一些有价值的东西，而牧师知道这一点。
\They were kind to you,\ the Bedraggled Parson says, abruptly and without vitriol, only a pale wonder, eyes fever-warm under the wilds of his hair. It is all he extends. \n\nWas he talking about the officials from the Bureau of Entertainments? Or someone else?=The Bedraggled Parson says, abruptly and without vitriol, only a pale wonder, eyes fever-warm under the wilds of his hair.。这是他的全部内容。\他说的是娱乐局的官员吗？还是别的人？
Something has changed. Something in the gasping air, the texture of light, the smell of Worlebury-juxta-Mare. Perhaps, it is the diminished presence of the Bureau officials, how their swagger has tautened to fear. Perhaps, it is the number of tourists with glass in their eyes, their smiles like they'd caught a fever-bright.=有些东西已经改变了。喘息的空气中的一些东西，光的质地，Worlebury-juxta-Mare的气味。也许，是局里官员的存在感减弱了，他们的豪言壮语已经紧缩成了恐惧。也许，这是在他们的眼睛里有玻璃的游客的数量，他们的笑容就像他们发了烧一样明亮。
Mists=薄雾
The Parson leads you away from the corpse-church and towards the edge of the beach. The mist reaches for your ankles.=牧师带领你离开尸体教堂，走向海滩的边缘。迷雾直达你的脚踝。
This is not terrifying at all. Not the thin leather filaments holding your body. Not the jerky descent into the fog, the cottony silence.\n\nBut at least the cheerful cultists at the shore seem optimistic about your chances.=这一点都不可怕。握住你身体的薄皮丝并不可怕。不是生硬的下降到雾中，是棉花般的寂静。但至少岸边那些欢快的邪教分子似乎对你的机会很乐观。

Here in the heavens there is no defence from the maddening light of the stars. Your crew  on edge, weary, already haunted by their long journeys in the sky  are susceptible. One succumbs, and the madness leaps to another and another as quick as fire. Within a day, they rave with delusions and obsessions. Your engine is on the brink of disaster.=在这里的天堂里，没有人可以抵御星辰的疯狂之光。你的船员处于紧张状态，疲惫不堪，已经被他们在天空中的长途旅行所困扰，他们很容易受到影响。一个人屈服了，疯狂的情绪就会像火一样迅速跳到另一个人身上。在一天之内，他们因妄想和痴迷而狂欢。你的引擎正处于灾难的边缘。
Here in the heavens there is no defence from the maddening light of the stars. Your crew, if you had one, would no doubt have cracked by now: made vulnerable by the horrors you have witnessed, the dangers you have escaped, the glorious, awful secrets you have learned.\n\nBut you have no crew. There is only you, and you are fine. Abosolutely fine. How could you not be? You are the lonely regent of this patch of the sky. The captain's chair is your throne. Your will is law. Is this how God felt, when the world was young?=在这里，在天堂里，没有人可以抵御星星的疯狂光芒。你的船员，如果你有的话，无疑现在已经崩溃了：你所目睹的恐怖，你所逃脱的危险，你所了解的光荣而可怕的秘密，使你变得脆弱。只有你，而且你很好。绝对的好。你怎么会不好呢？你是这片天空中孤独的摄政者。船长的椅子就是你的宝座。你的意志就是法律。这就是上帝的感觉，当世界还年轻的时候？
Mutiny=叛变
Is nothing loyal? Even your engine rebels! And you are alone now. There are no engineers to repair the draughty punctures in the hull, or the persistent rattle in that cluster of pipes beneath the boiler. When you fix one thing, another breaks. \n\nDepressingly, it is the rattle in the pipes which kills you.=没有什么是忠诚的吗？甚至你的引擎也叛变了！你现在是孤独的。而你现在是孤独的。没有工程师来修理车体上的通风孔，也没有工程师来修理锅炉下面的那组管道里持续不断的响声。当你修好一件事时，另一件事就坏了。\令人沮丧的是，正是管道中的响声使你丧命。
A gunshot thunders in the close confines of your engine. Boots clatter in the corridors. A mutiny has broken out among your crew!\n\n[There are no good options here. Each risks death.]=一声枪响在你的发动机的密闭空间里响起。靴子在走廊里咔咔作响。你的船员中发生了叛变！这里没有好的选择。 每个人都有死亡的危险。

Here in the heavens there is no defence from the maddening light of the stars. You had assumed the shades in your crew were not susceptible; but they have been behaving strangely. \n\nFirst, silent processions through the hallways. Then lighting candles outside your room while your slept. They showed one of the crew their faces and made her wear a mask. Now she is leading them to your door. They have a rope, a knife of stone, and a mask, just for you. They want you to come with them.=在天堂里，没有人可以抵御星辰的疯狂光芒。你曾以为你的船员中的阴暗面不会受到影响；但他们的行为却很奇怪。\首先，在走廊上进行无声的游行。然后在你睡觉的时候，在你的房间外面点燃蜡烛。他们给其中一个船员看了他们的脸，并让她戴上了面具。现在她正带领他们来到你的门口。他们有一根绳子，一把石刀，还有一个面具，就是为了你。他们想让你跟他们走。

But so does extortion.=有事发生了。有些船员看起来比较滋润。其他人则比以前更憔悴，身上有青紫的、未愈合的瘀伤。如果被追问，他们声称这些瘀伤是事故的结果。当然，船上会发生事故。但敲诈也是如此。
Starvation is your passenger, now. He stalks the corridors. He reaches out a pale finger, and another of you wastes away. You become accustomed to the discovery of cold, sunken corpses. =饿死是你的乘客，现在。他在走廊上走来走去。他伸出一根苍白的手指，你们中的另一个人就会消亡。你已经习惯了发现冰冷的、沉没的尸体。
The crew are starving. Hollow faces and wide, wolfish eyes. How the cold bites at your narrowed bodies! It's hard as diamond and sharp as a tooth! How can you stop this d__ned shivering?=船员们都在挨饿。空洞的脸和宽大的、狼一样的眼睛。寒冷是如何咬着你们狭长的身体的！这是个好主意。它像钻石一样坚硬，像牙齿一样锋利! 你怎么能停止这该死的颤抖？
Shaking hands. Stomach pangs. Delirium. It was only a matter of time before the accidents began. A corpse has been found in the engine room. A ruptured pipe released a fatal jet of steam. The body's flesh is seared. A sound from the gathered crew: someone just licked their lips.=颤抖的手。胃部的恐慌。谵妄。事故的发生只是时间问题。在引擎室发现了一具尸体。一个破裂的管道释放出致命的蒸汽喷射。尸体的肉体被烧焦了。聚集在一起的船员发出了一个声音：有人刚刚舔了一下嘴唇。

His frozen fingers extend to clasp yours as you step inside the room. He's laid out a table, candles, wine, a bouquet. His dining habits are exquisite, his conversation witty and appropriately light. He suggests a tour of Magdalene's when you're done. Halfway through the meal, you realise you are alone.=当你走进房间时，他冰冷的手指伸出来握住你的手指。他摆好了桌子，蜡烛，酒，花束。他的用餐习惯很讲究，他的谈话诙谐而适当地轻松。他建议你吃完后去参观马格达林餐厅。吃到一半的时候，你意识到你是一个人。
The room is cold as a morgue. Two beds have been prepared. Your friend is in one, already asleep. They are stacked like bunks, as though you were in a child's room, or perhaps a cabin. He is gone when you wake to the sound of the clock. =房间冷得像个停尸房。已经准备了两张床。你的朋友就在其中一张，已经睡着了。它们像床铺一样叠在一起，仿佛你是在一个孩子的房间里，或者也许是一个小木屋。当你被钟声吵醒时，他已经走了。
The room is as empty and cold as the cooling heart of a slain star. Your friend's gums are stretched in something of a smile. Your conversation is charming, amiable, raucous even. You are interrupted by the arrival of an attendant, not yet fully costumed. \So sorry I'm late. Shall we begin?\ =房间里空荡荡的，像一颗被杀死的星星的冷却的心一样冷。你的朋友的牙龈在某种程度上是微笑的。你们的谈话是迷人的，和蔼的，甚至是喧闹的。你被一个还没有穿好衣服的服务员的到来打断了。\很抱歉我迟到了。我们可以开始了吗？
Your friend is lounging on a low couch, his long fingers tapering over a bottle of wine. The room is chilled, which is a fine thing as the bottle is expensive. You talk late into the evening, as he surprises you with several educated guesses about your background, your family, your hobbies and your guilty secrets. \n\nHe confesses a few of his own to you. His own life in the Wilderness, as a captain adrift among the stars. His engine sounds familiar: his boilers started up at strange hours of the night too, his levers stuck at infuriating moments too, and his hull leaked warmth at a surprising rate, just as yours does. When the clock sounds, he smiles. \I shall see you again.\=你的朋友正躺在一张低矮的沙发上，他修长的手指放在一瓶酒上。房间是冰冷的，这是一件好事，因为这瓶酒很贵。你们聊到很晚，他对你的背景、你的家庭、你的爱好和你有罪的秘密进行了几次有根据的猜测，让你感到惊讶。\他向你坦白了他自己的一些秘密。他自己在荒野中的生活，作为一个船长在星空中漂泊。他的引擎听起来很熟悉：他的锅炉也在夜里奇怪的时间里启动，他的杠杆也在令人愤怒的时刻卡住，他的车体以惊人的速度泄漏温暖，就像你的一样。当钟声响起时，他笑了。\I shall see you again.
Mother=母亲
The kettle is on, filling the room with steam. Have you seen this room before? Her face is behind a veil, but the voice is right, as perfect as you've heard in dreams. \I've sent everyone away so we can talk properly. You still take sugar, yes?\ =水壶开了，房间里充满了蒸汽。你以前见过这个房间吗？她的脸在面纱后面，但声音是正确的，就像你在梦中听到的那样完美。\我已经把所有人都打发走了，这样我们就可以好好谈谈。你还在吃糖，是吗？

Her hands meet yours over the uncorked champagne. \You know we haven't long left.\ The clock chimes and she is gone.= 妈妈带来了一个野餐篮子，里面装着所有你最喜欢的东西。她讲述了你从未听说过的故事，以及你从未想过的她所过的生活。她的手在未开瓶的香槟酒上与你相遇。\你知道我们没有离开多久。钟声响起，她就走了。
Mother sits behind a screen today. Her head aches, she says, but is dismissive of any intimation of concern on your part. She wants only to hear your concerns. She has her knitting. \I thought your engine could use a little colour,\ she says. Hookah smoke emerges in billows from behind the painted screen.=母亲今天坐在屏幕后面。她说，她的头很痛，但对你的任何关心暗示都不屑一顾。她只想听听你的担忧。她有她的针织品。\她说：我想你的引擎可以使用一点颜色。她说：我认为你的引擎可以用点颜色，她说。胡克烟从画屏后面冒出来。。
Victoria=维多利亚
You enter the ballroom, your invitation clutched to your chest. Your name in gold writing flashes under the lamplight. A beautiful heir fills out your dance card and leads you into the centre of the room, where couples are engaged in the pavane. From her throne under a blazing halo of candles, Her Enduring Majesty smiles briefly in your direction.=你走进舞厅，你的邀请函紧紧地抱在胸前。你的名字用金色的文字在灯火下闪烁着。一位美丽的继承人填写了你的舞卡，并把你领到房间的中央，那里的情侣们正在亭子里约会。在炽热的蜡烛光环下的宝座上，持久的女王陛下向你简短地微笑。
You have been invited to a private dinner at New Clarence House. Starlight filters over the table through the glass windows that gaze out over all Albion. Your dinnerware is arrayed in sixes: six forks, six knives, six goblets. You stand for every toast, including one given in your honour. The Captivating Princess demands you give the speech. You raise your glass to Her Enduring Majesty, and even venture a joke. Her laughter is quick and sudden as ice breaking on a lake in winter.=你们被邀请参加在新克拉伦斯宫举行的私人晚宴。星光透过玻璃窗洒在餐桌上，玻璃窗外是整个阿尔比恩。你的餐具以六为单位排列：六把叉子、六把刀、六个高脚杯。每一次敬酒你都要站着，包括为你敬酒的一次。迷人的公主要求你发表演讲。你向持久的女王陛下举杯，甚至大胆地开个玩笑。她的笑声是快速而突然的，就像冬天湖面上的碎冰。
Now. An ageing chamberlain anoints your forehead with the chrism, while the most senior lady-in-waiting tucks your scroll of minted hours under your arm. A handmaid adjusts your tabard, so that the gold of the new sun on your breast is clearly visible beneath the light of the chandeliers. You are shown how to process towards the throne. One foot before the other, slow and measured, head held upright, so that your eyes are always just below your Sovereign's. And then the doors are thrown open. Your name is called by the herald. You step into the incandescent golden light, where you can just make out the outline of Victoria on her Throne of Hours. The sword in her hand catches the light briefly. =现在，一位年迈的内侍在你的额头上涂上圣礼，而最资深的女侍则将你的铸币时间卷轴夹在你的腋下。一个女仆调整你的头巾，使你胸前的新太阳的金色在吊灯的照耀下清晰可见。有人告诉你如何走向王座。一只脚走在另一只脚之前，缓慢而有分寸地走着，头部保持直立，以便你的眼睛始终在你的君主的下方。然后，门被推开。传令官叫出了你的名字。你步入白炽的金光中，在那里你只能看到维多利亚在她的时辰宝座上的轮廓。她手中的剑短暂地照亮了光线。
You have been invited to a garden party at the Palace. You are escorted to the lawn by a senior footman, where you are introduced to a social-climbing duchess and a disgraceful viscount. You exchange witticisms together while a footman refills your glasses. \n\nThe peal of a single trumpet interrupts your conversation. You and the other guests are shepherded into a line as Her Enduring Majesty passes by. She favours you with a wintry gaze before proceeding to more important guests in the marquee.=你被邀请参加皇宫的一个花园聚会。你被一个高级男仆护送到草坪上，在那里你被介绍给一个攀比的公爵夫人和一个丢脸的子爵。在一个男仆给你们续杯的时候，你们一起交换了一些俏皮话。\一阵阵的喇叭声打断了你们的谈话。你和其他客人在女王陛下经过时被引导成一排。她用凛冽的目光注视着你，然后继续走向帐篷里更重要的客人。

The elderly rat blinks several times. \Cinders?

I was wondering when this day would come.\ 他的声音颤抖着，就像学校音乐会上不幸的长笛独奏。\亲爱的主席，我建议你在这次采访期间不要动，甚至不要眨眼，否则我怀疑有人会做出不愉快的事情。中尉把注意力转回给你。\在你做任何事情之前，我有一件事要告诉你。
There are guards watching the workers. There are guards watching the machinery (valuable if dismantled; disastrous if sabotaged). There are guards watching the upper doors into the private offices of the Company Board. \n\nStill, they can't watch everywhere. After only a few minutes you've identified the door to the Lt's office. The little rat-hole cut into the bottom of the door gives it away.=有守卫在监视工人。有守卫在监视机器（如果被拆除就很有价值；如果被破坏就会有灾难）。有警卫看着进入公司董事会私人办公室的上层门。\尽管如此，他们不可能到处监视。仅仅过了几分钟，你就确定了通往中尉办公室的门。门底的小老鼠洞把它暴露了。
Cinders shakes her head and cocks her gun. \No. Not having it. What ______ proof do you even have?\ The Lt spreads his paws on the table. \I suspect the only proof left is in the vault. I'll give you my number regardless. I would ask you spare me until you've entered it, at least.\ In her paws, Cinder's gun wobbles. =Cinders摇摇头，举起了她的枪。\不，没有了。你甚至有什么______ 证据？中尉把他的爪子摊在桌子上。\我怀疑唯一剩下的证据是在保险库里。无论如何，我都会给你我的号码。我想请你至少在你进入它之前放过我。在她的爪子里，辛德的枪晃动着。
Vault=金库
The clerk leads you through an interminable series of hallways, through offices, studies, and libraries. At last, you arrive at a spiral staircase of wrought iron. You descend flight after flight, the Brigade growing heavy on your shoulders. Eventually, you emerge into a chamber whose walls are set with many metal doors. The clerk unlocks one and steps aside.=书记员带领你穿过一系列无尽的走廊，穿过办公室、书房和图书馆。最后，你来到了一个锻铁的螺旋形楼梯。你下了一层又一层，旅部在你肩上越来越重。最后，你们来到一个房间，墙上有许多金属门。书记员打开一个门锁，走到一边。
Further doors extend from the central vault. Each bears a brass plaque with the name of a member of the Rat Brigade. In the centre of the vault, a piece of paper rests on a stone dais. The note reads, in tiny handwriting, 'I'm sorry.'=更多的门从中央金库延伸出来。每个门上都有一个铜牌，上面写着老鼠大队成员的名字。在金库的中央，一张纸片放在一个石台上。纸条上的字迹很小，写着'我很抱歉'。
The Rat Brigade are playing cards. Cinders is cheating  by means of mirrors concealed in the sleeves of her uniform, a spring-loaded trap, and brazen card-counting. Albrecht and Petronella have devised a surreptitious drinking game around each new display of bad sportsratship.=老鼠大队正在玩牌。辛德斯通过隐藏在她制服袖子里的镜子、一个弹簧陷阱和厚颜无耻的算牌来作弊。阿尔布雷希特和佩特罗内拉围绕着每一次新的不良运动精神的展示，设计了一个偷偷摸摸的喝酒游戏。
Only Albrecht is available for conversation today. Petronella is nursing a hangover. Cinders has, in a gesture of kindness, gone to the galley to seek some kind of food-based cure. \n\nAlbrecht steeps a tea for you both. \This tea is a particular delicacy. From Achlys, I believe.\ His conversation is extensive, erudite and acerbic.=今天只有阿尔布雷希特可以谈话。佩特罗内拉正在喝宿醉。为了表示善意，Cinders已经去厨房寻求某种基于食物的治疗。\阿尔布雷希特为你们俩沏了一杯茶。\这杯茶是一种特别的美味佳肴。我相信是来自Achlys。 他的谈话是广泛的、博学的和尖刻的。
Cinders is engaged in an increasingly physical argument with Petronella over the proper upkeep of a tiny hand cannon. Albrecht has long given up attempting to soothe matters with tea. He has found a nice bottle of red and has deteriorated to watching while providing acidic commentary.=Cinders正在与Petronella就一门小手炮的适当维护问题进行越来越激烈的争论。阿尔布雷希特早已放弃了用茶来抚慰事情的尝试。他找到了一瓶上好的红葡萄酒，并退化到一边看一边提供酸溜溜的评论。
The Rat Brigade are nostalgic today. Each rat is competing to tell the most gruesome story of their past exploits. The time they infiltrated Sweet Jane's banquet at Port Prosper. The twilight rendezvous in the ruins of Port Avon. The brief alliance with the Parsimonious Chairman on the Albertine Expanse. Limbs are brandished; scars are counted.=老鼠大队今天很怀念。每只老鼠都在争先恐后地讲述他们过去的经历中最可怕的故事。他们潜入斯威特-简在普罗斯珀港的宴会的那次。在雅芳港废墟中的黄昏会合。在阿尔贝丁大陆上与吝啬鬼主席的短暂联盟。挥舞着四肢；计算着伤痕。

Beyond a few Cinder enthusiasts, transporting the stuff is not a point of pride. It is a business like any other; they take the goods, and drop them off for pay. \n=除了少数煤渣爱好者之外，运输这种东西并不是一件值得骄傲的事。这和其他的生意一样；他们拿着货物，把它们送出去，然后再付钱。\n
Because of the number of protesters who've set up tents in the Nature Reserve, it is difficult to find any captain who'll speak about Cinders. A few, and only when drunk, hint that they still transport it on behalf of the Company for a good fee.The rest are either too ashamed to admit to it, or else are truly against such work.=由于在自然保护区搭起帐篷的抗议者太多，很难找到愿意谈论煤渣的队长。少数人，而且只有在喝醉的情况下，才会暗示他们仍然代表公司运输它，以获得丰厚的费用。其余的人要么太羞于承认，要么就真的反对这种工作。
Transporting Cinders is good business. Some captains signed contracts with Leadbeater & Stainrod committing to carrying only that product; other enterprising souls have set up arrangements with the company to bring Cinder enthusiasts to the park for a closer look at the product. They've all seen it go wrong once or twice for some weak-willed individual who couldn't handle a pinch of Cinder; but no one blames the snuff.\n=运输煤渣是很好的生意。一些船长与Leadbeater & Stainrod公司签订了合同，承诺只运输该产品；其他有进取心的人则与该公司建立了安排，将煤渣爱好者带到公园，仔细观察该产品。他们都见过一些意志薄弱的人出过一两次差错，他们无法处理一撮煤渣；但没有人责怪鼻烟。

Break with thine iron rod, the Tyrannies of sin.\=会众是丰富多彩的。一群艺术家和来访的商人比一小群戴着高帽的当地人要多。他们一起唱出 上帝啊，你的国降临。\O'er heathen lands afar, thick darkness broodeth yet; Arise o morning star, rise and never set. 用你的铁棒打碎罪恶的暴政。

throne_description=王座_描述
\Don't panic,\ says one of the knights. \The Throne binds all who sit upon it. Just stay calm and let it do its work.\=不要惊慌，一个骑士说。\王座对所有坐在它上面的人都有约束力。只要保持冷静，让它发挥自己的作用。
At the castle you are met by a band of fellow knights. They feast you, ply you with wine, generally make you feel welcome.\n\nOnce you are sated, they lead you to an enormous oaken table. Each sits around the table, leaving just one chair empty  a throne of rough basalt.\n\n\The Blindness Throne,\ says the commander of the knights. \Only those worthy of the Cup may sit on it and keep their eyesight.\=在城堡里，你被一帮骑士伙伴所迎接。他们宴请你，给你灌酒，总之让你感到很受欢迎。一旦你吃饱了，他们就把你带到一张巨大的橡木桌前。每个人都围着桌子坐着，只留下一把空椅子 一个粗糙的玄武岩的宝座。失明宝座，骑士们的指挥官说。\只有那些配得上圣杯的人才能坐在上面，保持他们的视力。
The candles sputter and extinguish. The knights freeze in place, still as statues. \n\nA pit opens beneath the Blindness Throne and swallows you whole. Demons flock about you in the darkness, warty-skinned gargoyles who inspect you like a prize turkey. \n\nAfter a moment's chatter, one of them unscrews the top of your skull and begins rifling through its contents like a frenzied burglar. \n\n\We'll take everything from you,\ hisses another of the demons, his hot breath in your ear.=蜡烛溅起并熄灭了。骑士们僵在原地，像雕像一样一动不动。\在失明王座下面打开一个坑，把你整个吞进去。黑暗中，恶魔们蜂拥而至，这些长着疣状皮肤的妖怪们像检查火鸡一样检查你。\聊了一会儿后，其中一个人拧开了你的头盖骨，开始像个疯狂的小偷一样翻找里面的东西。\我们会拿走你的一切，另一个恶魔嘶吼着，他的热气在你耳边响起。
As the demons vanish, you find yourself transported back to the Castle of the Seraphim. But all is not well. \n\nThe knights have taken off their friendly faces, revealing warty flesh and sharp teeth. They must be demons themselves, or at least in allegiance with demons. One of them is approaching you, a sizzling-red poker held aloft, ready to put out your eyes and finish the Throne's work.=随着恶魔们的消失，你发现自己被送回了塞拉芬城堡。但一切并不顺利。\骑士们摘下了他们友好的面孔，露出了疣状的肉和锋利的牙齿。他们自己一定是恶魔，或者至少是对恶魔效忠的人。他们中的一个正向你走来，高举着一根烧红的火钳，准备熄灭你的眼睛，完成王座的工作。
Your iron will has triumphed over foulest sorcery. The grip of the cursed throne has released you. An oppressive weight is lifted. You stand. \n\nThe demon-knights reel back in terror as you draw your black-bladed sword.=你的钢铁意志已经战胜了最肮脏的巫术。被诅咒的王座的控制权已经释放了你。一个压迫性的重量被解除了。你站起来了。\当你拔出你的黑刃剑时，恶魔骑士们在恐惧中后退。
waxwork_description=waxwork_description
\Cut open any purses or pockets you find,\ says the Ringleader. A knife-wielding ruffian nods and steps forward. \Empty their boots, look behind their ears. We don't want to miss a single coin. This one looks wealthier than the usual lunatics we get.\=切开你找到的任何钱包或口袋，领头人说。一个持刀的流氓点点头，走了过来。\清空他们的靴子，看看他们的耳朵后面。我们不想错过任何一个硬币。这个人看起来比我们通常遇到的疯子更富有。
The Ringleader snaps his fingers, and one of the robbers approaches you with a blindfold.\n\nFor just a moment, his face becomes a demon's. The rag in his hands becomes a sizzling red poker.\n\nIf the robbers successfully blindfold you and knock you out, you realise, you'll have failed the test of the Blindness Throne. You will be unworthy of the Cup.=领头人打了个响指，一个强盗带着眼罩向你走来。只一会儿，他的脸就变成了恶魔的脸。如果强盗们成功地蒙住你的眼睛并把你打晕，你就会意识到，你没有通过失明王座的测试。你将不配拥有这杯酒。
The Ringleader watches with keen interest as a knife-wielding ruffian begins to cut open your pockets, slices your purse, even removes and empties your boots. Coins spill across the floor. The waxwork silhouettes of Mary Antoinette and Genghis Khan bear silent witness.=领头人饶有兴趣地看着一个持刀的流氓开始切开你的口袋，切开你的钱包，甚至把你的靴子脱下来，倒掉。硬币洒落一地。玛丽-安托瓦内特和成吉思汗的蜡像默默地见证着。
The robbers still seem unaware that you have slipped your bonds. You only have a few precious seconds to act.=强盗们似乎还没有意识到你已经逃脱了你的束缚。你只有几秒钟的宝贵时间来采取行动。
You take a moment to absorb your surroundings.\n\nThis is not a castle, but a disused and unlit waxwork museum. It's difficult to tell which of the silhouettes in the shadows are wax and which are real. A red-faced Henry VIII looms beside you, covered in a thin film of dust.\n\nThe seat you had thought was the Blindness Throne is actually a dentist's chair. There are straps at the armrests.=你花点时间吸收你的环境。这不是一座城堡，而是一个废弃的、没有灯光的蜡像馆。很难分辨阴影中的人影哪些是蜡像，哪些是真的。一个满脸通红的亨利八世在你身边晃来晃去，身上覆盖着一层薄薄的灰尘。你以为是失明王座的座位实际上是一把牙医椅。扶手处有带子。

bridge_description=桥梁_描述
You ride until your destrier is sheened with sweat, forcing you to stop by a stream and dismount. As it drinks, you unbuckle your armour and rest in the shade of an apple tree.\n\n\An excellent horse. You ride it too hard.\ \n\nA wizened old hermit has appeared beside your horse, stroking its heaving flanks. \You seek the Cloak of the Lion, yes? I can guide you to its location, if you confess your sins.\=你骑着马，直到你的驯鹿被汗水浸透，迫使你在一条小河边停下来，下马。在它喝水的时候，你解开你的盔甲，在一棵苹果树的树荫下休息。你骑得太辛苦了。 \一个年老的隐士出现在你的马旁边，抚摸着它高耸的侧腹。\你在寻找狮子的斗篷，是吗？如果你忏悔你的罪过，我可以引导你到它的位置。
Across the Falchion Bridge, a pair of enormous antlers rise like totems from the mud. They are easily three times as tall as you. Tangled at their tip is a bundle of cloth. The Cloak of the Lion.\n\nBut the antlers are impossible to climb. They burn your fingers at the touch, as though made of flame.\n\nWith dread certainty, you know what must be done. An offering must be made.=在Falchion桥的对面，一对巨大的鹿角像图腾一样从泥土中升起。它们很容易就有你三倍的高度。在它们的顶端缠着一捆布。狮子的斗篷。但鹿角是无法攀爬的。你的手指一碰就会被烧伤，就像火焰做的一样。以可怕的确定性，你知道必须做什么。必须做一个祭品。
You follow the shuffling hermit up a hillside, your boots sinking into the mud. Thunder rumbles. Lightning splits the sky.\n\nAt the hilltop you find yourself standing beside a gorge so deep you cannot see the bottom. It's far too wide to leap; the only crossing-point is a bridge.\n\n\The cloak lies across the Falchion Bridge,\ says the hermit. \Only a worthy quester may cross without slicing himself in two.\=你跟着那个趿拉着鞋的隐士走上山坡，你的靴子陷进了泥里。雷声隆隆。在山顶上，你发现自己站在一个深不见底的峡谷旁。它太宽了，无法跳跃；唯一的交叉点是一座桥。隐士说：斗篷在Falchion桥对面。\只有一个有价值的探索者才能在不把自己切成两半的情况下通过。
tower_description=塔的描述
You stand beside the stream, occasionally double-checking the number of moons. The stray cat curls up beside you and falls asleep. You have no real idea where to go from here.=你站在小河边上，偶尔会仔细检查一下月亮的数量。流浪猫蜷缩在你身边，睡着了。你没有真正的想法，不知道从这里该往哪里走。
The walls have crumbled away at the tower's top. A scything wind scours your flesh. The cat shivers by your side.\n\nThe other tower lies far across from you, and you can see a bundle of cloth tangled in a weather-vane. Could that be the cloak?\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to cross from this tower to the other is a narrow wooden beam, half-rotted, sagging with damp. The forest floor is hundreds of feet below.=塔顶的墙壁已经崩塌了。一阵镰刀般的风刮过你的肉体。另一座塔就在你的对面，你可以看到一束布被向风缠住。不幸的是，从这座塔到另一座塔的唯一通道是一根狭窄的木梁，已经半腐烂，因潮湿而下垂。下面是数百英尺的森林地面。
You've reached the top of the second tower. It seems, somehow, even less stable than the first. With every gust of wind, it sways.\n\nA dirty old flag of indeterminate origin is tangled in the upper reaches of a rusted, tilting weather-vane. Is this really the cloak that the Queen sent you to collect?\n\nTo retrieve it, you'll have to climb out above a dizzyingly precipitous drop.=你已经到了第二座塔的顶部。不知何故，它似乎比第一座更不稳定。每一阵风吹来，它都会摇晃。一面来历不明的肮脏的旧旗子在一个生锈的、倾斜的向风的上游纠缠在一起。Is this really the cloak that the Queen sent you to collect?（要取回它，你必须爬出一个令人眩晕的悬崖。

We are the Blue Kingdom, after all. Go to New Winchester and spread the word that we can answer any questions or worries the citizens have about their own mortality.\=The living are obsessed with death, says the Orator. \但死人根本不关心活人。这种不平衡意味着活人对死亡有很多疑问，而他们得到的答案却少得可怜。如果我们要吸引更多潜在的信徒加入大使馆，我们应该宣传我们能提供的答案。毕竟，我们是蓝色王国。到新温彻斯特去宣传，我们可以回答公民对自己死亡的任何问题或担忧。
\Our work principally concerns the spreading of the Philosophy of the Blue Kingdom,\ says the Orator, with the air of a man for whom monologues come naturally. \This is the purpose of the Embassy. We are not here to concern ourselves with diplomacy and mortal squabbles.\n\n\So please understand that while this assignment may be diplomatically disastrous, it is key to our Philosophy. Travel to London and publicly denounce the Empress who thinks herself eternal. Specifically, discredit her efforts to prolong the false life of her consort.\=我们的工作主要是传播蓝色王国的哲学，演说家说，带着一种自然的独白的气质。\这就是大使馆的目的。我们在这里不是为了关心外交和凡人的争吵。所以请理解，虽然这个任务在外交上可能是灾难性的，但它是我们哲学的关键。前往伦敦，公开谴责那个自以为是的皇后。特别是，诋毁她为延长其妃子的虚假生命所做的努力。
\The stars are much-maligned in the Reach,\ says the Orator sorrowfully. \Perhaps because of that clockwork abomination. The citizenry must be taught that entities such as the Sapphir'd King are not threatening in the slightest  why, they protect us from falling into the darkness of Eleutheria! They keep us whole and safe and together under a single immutable law. There is no greater comfort, my friend, than knowing that the sun will rise tomorrow as expected.\n\n\As such, I require you to travel to New Winchester and spread the argument that the stars are above us for good reason.\=明星们在Reach是很有名望的，演讲者悲伤地说道。\也许是因为那个发条的憎恶。公民们必须被教育，像萨菲尔王这样的实体丝毫不具威胁性，为什么？他们保护我们不至于落入埃卢瑟亚的黑暗中！。他们使我们保持完整和安全，并在一个单一的不可改变的法律下团结一致。没有比知道明天的太阳会如期升起更让人欣慰的了。因此，我要求你去新温彻斯特，传播星星在我们头上是有原因的说法。
\There are many names for the philosophy that holds sway in the Blue Kingdom. The Philosophy of Culmination. The Cessation Accords. The Aramanthine Conjunction. \n\n\Names differ, but the tenets remain the same. The core of the Philosophy is that all things must end, and must be brought to an end with minimal fuss.\ The Orator pauses knowingly. \There are ways to spread this mode of thought without making reference to the Blue Kingdom even once. I want you to travel to Titania and commission a statue that celebrates endings. Any kind of ending will do.\=There are many names for the philosophy that holds sway in the Blue Kingdom. 终结的哲学。终止协议。Aramanthine Conjunction。\名称不同，但信条不变。哲学的核心是，所有的事情都必须结束，而且必须以最小的代价结束。演讲者有意地停顿了一下。\有一些方法可以在不提及蓝色王国的情况下传播这种思想模式。我想让你去泰坦尼亚，委托制作一个赞美结局的雕像。任何类型的结局都可以。

The Mellifluous Orator introduces you to someone he describes as an 'up and coming' young artist: a broad-shouldered woman with a shaved head and tattoos coating both her muscular arms. Apparently she specialises in painting startling scenes of a futuristic world united under the Philosophy.\n\n\I think our friend here can do good work spreading enthusiasm for our Philosophy in Worlebury-juxta-Mare,\ says the Orator. =Mellifluous Orator向你介绍了一个被他描述为'新兴'的年轻艺术家的人：一个肩部宽阔的女人，剃着头，两只肌肉发达的手臂上都有纹身。显然，她擅长画一个未来世界的惊人场景，在哲学的指导下团结一致。我认为我们的朋友可以做很好的工作，在沃勒伯里-朱克斯塔-马尔为我们的哲学传播热情，演讲者说。
The Mellifluous Orator introduces you to someone he describes as an 'up and coming' political essayist: a slender woman with cold eyes and a knife at her hip. Apparently she has written several articles about the dangers posed by chaotic Eleutheria, and the Windward Company's need for an alliance with the more reliable Blue Kingdom. \n\n\Of course, we need people in Port Prosper to actually read what she's writing,\ says the Orator. \Can you take her there? I've already secured her a regular column in an evening newspaper.\,Mellifluous Orator向你介绍了一个他称之为 新兴的 政治散文家的人：一个身材苗条的女人，眼神冷漠，腰间有一把刀。显然，她写了几篇关于混乱的埃卢塞亚所带来的危险，以及向风公司需要与更可靠的蓝色王国结盟的文章。\当然，我们需要普罗斯珀港的人真正阅读她写的东西，演讲者说。\你能带她去吗？我已经为她争取到了一个晚报上的定期专栏。
The Mellifluous Orator introduces you to a young woman with serious eyes and a scarred face. She's a musician, by all accounts a rare talent; and after attending several of the Orator's sermons she has become, of course, a fanatical adherent of the Philosophy.\n\n\Her music could make a statue weep,\ says the Orator. \She sings about the arc of history coming to an end. She sings about stillness, and emptiness, and dreams of a calmer world. I think Titania could benefit from her presence, don't you?\=Mellifluous Orator 向你介绍了一个年轻的女人，她有一双严肃的眼睛和一张有疤的脸。她是一个音乐家，从各方面来说都是一个难得的人才；在参加了演讲者的几次布道后，她当然成了哲学的狂热信徒。她的音乐可以让雕像哭泣，演讲者说。\她唱的是历史的弧线即将结束。她唱的是寂静，是空虚，是对一个更平静的世界的梦想。我认为泰坦尼亚可以从她的存在中受益，你说呢？
The Mellifluous Orator introduces you to a blonde-haired, sharp-nosed woman with fire burning behind her eyes. She's been at Hybras almost since the beginning, and after absorbing dozens of the Orator's speeches, she's become a fanatic of the Philosophy. \n\n\What she lacks in finesse she makes up for in passion,\ says the Orator. \I think we should send her somewhere where there's revolution already in the air. Somewhere that'll respond well to strong words and iron will. Somewhere like the Brabazon Workworld.\=Mellifluous Orator 向你介绍了一个金发碧眼、鼻子尖尖的女人，她的眼睛后面燃烧着火焰。她几乎从一开始就在Hybras，在吸收了几十个演讲者的演讲后，她已经成为哲学的狂热者。\演讲者说：她缺少的是技巧，她弥补的是激情。\I think we should send her somewhere where there's revolution already in the air. 在某个地方，对强硬的语言和铁的意志有良好的反应。像布拉巴宗工作世界那样的地方。
The Mellifluous Orator introduces you to someone he describes as an 'up and coming' young poet: a greasy-haired young man whose breath is laced with booze. Apparently he grew interested in the Philosophy after struggling to come up with an ending for one of his own poems. \n\n\I think our friend here can do good work spreading the tenets of our Philosophy in London,\ says the Orator. \He's already received publishing offers for his thirteen-line Sonnets of Termination.\=Mellifluous Orator向你介绍了一个被他描述为'新兴'的年轻诗人：一个满头油污的年轻人，他的呼吸中带着酒气。显然，他是在为自己的一首诗想出一个结尾后，对哲学产生了兴趣。\演讲者说：我认为我们的朋友可以在伦敦很好地传播我们哲学的信条。\他已经收到了关于他的十三行终止十四行诗的出版邀请。
The Mellifluous Orator introduces you to a grey-bearded, bespectacled man whom he refers to as a prominent philosopher and scholar. Apparently he's spent some time at Hybras learning about the Philosophy, and now he's keen to return to his post at a university in New Winchester.\n\n\It goes without saying, but the professor very much approves of what we're doing here,\ says the Orator. \It would be invaluable to have someone like him embedded in New Winchester academia.\=演讲者向你介绍了一个灰胡子、长着眼镜的人，他说他是一个著名的哲学家和学者。显然，他在Hybras花了一些时间学习哲学，现在他很想回到他在新温彻斯特大学的岗位上。不用说，但教授非常赞同我们在这里做的事情，演讲者说。\如果有他这样的人在新温彻斯特的学术界，那将是非常宝贵的。

The spirit under trial is a man who dabbled with immortality when he was alive. He died in the end, but he didn't quite die all the way.=受审的精神是一个人，他活着的时候曾涉足过不朽。他最后死了，但他并没有完全死掉。
The spirit under trial is a woman who committed horrific crimes in life. The Jewelled Judge is sparing with the details, but the crimes seem to be particularly ambitious, mass-scale atrocities.=受审的精神是一个生前犯下可怕罪行的女人。宝石法官对细节不加说明，但这些罪行似乎是特别雄心勃勃的大规模暴行。
The spirit under trial is an Ephemera who has been bounced around the Blue Kingdom for decades. Its case-file is a stack of stone tablets that the Jewelled Judge reads through with evident horror. The spirit just wants to be declared Dead, but its papers have been repeatedly misfiled, its soul raises all sorts of false alarms among the spirit-measurers, and its corpse was exhumed and used in unsettling experiments. All this has apparently greatly complicated its post-mortem status.=受审的精神是一个在蓝色王国里被颠簸了几十年的史诗人物。它的案卷是一叠石板，珠宝法官带着明显的惊恐读完了。这个灵魂只想被宣布死亡，但它的文件一再被错误地归档，它的灵魂在精神测量师中引起了各种错误的警报，它的尸体被挖掘出来并被用于令人不安的实验。这一切显然使它的死后状况变得非常复杂。

It is said that the lakes at the top of Regent's Tears have curative properties. This rumour goes largely unconfirmed  the ground by the lakes is too boggy to land a locomotive.\n\nInstead, you must land on a sharp, slippery ledge lower down the falls. The walk up will be punishing.=据说摄政王之泪顶部的湖泊有治疗作用。这个传言在很大程度上没有得到证实，湖边的地面太过泥泞，无法让火车头降落。相反，你必须降落在瀑布下方一个尖锐、湿滑的壁架上。往上走会很痛苦。
The view from the top of the Tears is dizzying. The forest is so large and you are so high that all perspective is lost. Only your locomotive, small as a match box, breaks the illusion of a mossy meadow inches from your feet. \n\nYou step back from the drop and turn to the lake. It is huge  you cannot make out any details of its far shore. Steam rises sluggishly from the surface: the water is warm!=从眼泪山顶上看去，景色令人眼花缭乱。森林是如此之大，你是如此之高，以至于所有的视角都消失了。只有你的火车头，小如火柴盒，打破了离你脚下几英寸的青苔草地的幻觉。\你从落差上退下来，转向湖面。它是巨大的，你无法看清它远处海岸的任何细节。蒸汽从表面迟缓地升起：水是温暖的！
A man is supporting his son in the water, keeping him afloat. The boy kicks and splashes you, then giggles.=一个男人在水中支撑着他的儿子，让他漂浮起来。男孩踢了你一脚，溅了你一身水，然后咯咯笑起来。
Several young Londoners sit quietly on the bank, resting their feet in the steaming water.=几个年轻的伦敦人静静地坐在岸上，把脚搁在热气腾腾的水中。
An old man sits in the water, leaning up against a rock. He gives you a nod in greeting. =一位老人坐在水里，靠着一块石头。他向你点头示意，表示问候。
A youth gives you a fleeting smile. He seems welcoming enough, and there's plenty of room in the shallows.=一个年轻人给你一个短暂的微笑。他似乎很受欢迎，而且浅滩上有很多空间。
A young couple, sitting an improperly scant three feet apart, are immersed in the water.=一对年轻的夫妇，不适当地相隔三尺，沉浸在水中。
A young couple, sitting an improperly scant three feet, apart are immersed in the water.=一对年轻夫妇，相隔不适当的三英尺，正沉浸在水里。
BranchResult=分支结果
It is clear why the man has to support his son. The left foot of the boy is entirely glass; it twinkles beautifully as he kicks and squirms. The weight would pull him under, were he left alone.=很明显，这个男人为什么要支持他的儿子。男孩的左脚完全是玻璃的；当他踢动和蠕动时，它闪烁着美丽的光芒。如果让他独自一人，重量会把他拉下去。
To be heard over the sound of the falls, you move close to the youth. He has been weeping. He is frank as to the cause of his sorrow  the Winchester War. He speaks of his constant fortune  to survive skirmishes that have slaughtered his friends. \Fortune!\ he repeats sourly.=为了在瀑布的声音中被听到，你靠近了这个年轻人。他一直在哭泣。他坦率地说出了他悲伤的原因--温彻斯特战争。他说他一直很幸运，在屠杀朋友的小规模战斗中幸存下来。\财富！他酸溜溜地重复道。
They are a group of infamous hell-raisers, known from old London clubs, and never out of the gossip pages of the lower brow broadsheets group. Yet here they are, calm as still waters. \n\nOne acknowledges your recognition with a rueful smile. \We came here for a lark. But it it all seems pointless, now.\=他们是一群臭名昭著的地狱之徒，在伦敦的老牌俱乐部中闻名，从未离开过低眉大眼的大报集团的八卦版面。然而，他们在这里，像静水一样平静。\一个人用一个沮丧的微笑承认了你的身份。\我们来这里是为了玩玩。但现在看来，这一切都毫无意义。
The gruff gentleman with the complexion of a boiled ham frowns through the steam. He bellows an enquiry as to your health. He is here to ease the excruciations inflicted by his joints. The words he uses to describe the climb to the pool are rarely heard out of engine boiler rooms. =这位脸色像煮熟的火腿的粗鲁的先生在蒸汽中皱着眉头。他大声询问你的健康状况。他是来缓解他的关节所带来的痛苦的。他用来描述爬到水池的话语在锅炉房里是很少听到的。
To be heard over the sound of the falls you must sit equally close. \nThe couple welcome you warmly, and all too easily slip into discussion of the family they hope for. Their accents reveal a scandalous class disparity  no wonder they are coy about their identities.=要想在瀑布的声音中被听到，你必须坐得同样近。\这对夫妇热情地欢迎你，并且很容易就陷入他们所希望的家庭的讨论中。他们的口音透露出一种可耻的阶级差异，难怪他们对自己的身份讳莫如深。

%{Old Flame=%{古老的火焰
Old Flame=古老的火焰
The room is as you left it that last time. They are stood, cigar in hand, facing the window where you left them. The smoke has stained the glass thunder grey. They turn as you shut the door. Is that a list in their hand? They have been waiting some time for this.=这个房间和你上次离开时一样。他们站着，手里拿着雪茄，面对着你离开时的窗户。烟雾已经把玻璃染成了雷同的灰色。你关上门的时候，他们转过身来。他们手里拿的是一份名单吗？他们已经等了一段时间了。
The room has been decorated as you remember it. The old headboard that creaked at inopportune moments. The stuffed animal remains sat on the bedside cabinet, even more threadbare than before. \n\nThey are sat in the old wicker chair by the fire. They stand to greet you, taking your head in their hands, that are just a little more lined than you recall. Two glasses have been poured. A carafe stands at the side, waiting for you to indulge as much or as little as you please. =房间的装饰和你记忆中的一样。那块老旧的床头板，在不恰当的时候吱吱作响。毛绒动物的残骸坐在床头柜上，甚至比以前更丝毫不减。\他们坐在火炉旁的旧柳条椅上。他们站起来迎接你，把你的头放在他们的手里，他们的手比你记忆中的要多一点。两只杯子已经倒好了。一个咖啡壶站在边上，等着你随心所欲地喝或不喝。
Is that the chair where you? Is that the picture you drew after? All is exactly as you remember, a simulacrum perfect to the finest detail. \n\nThey are watching you warily, all the gathered apparatus of your vice laid out before them. Their hand wavers. They smile as you close the door. A return? Or a release? =那是你所在的椅子吗？那是你之后画的画吗？一切都和你记忆中的一模一样，是完美到极致的模拟。\他们正警惕地看着你，你的副业的所有设备都摆在他们面前。他们的手摇摆不定。当你关门时，他们微笑着。是回归？还是释放？
The room is dark and shrouded. Only a few brief candles outline their silhouette before the bed. Their hand meets yours in the darkness, as they guide you to the window. \n\n\Let me tell you of all that I have done since we parted.\ Their quick breath fogs the glass as they roll out a fabricated but plausible litany of the years that have divided you.=房间是黑暗的，笼罩着的。只有几根简短的蜡烛在床前勾勒出他们的轮廓。他们的手在黑暗中与你相遇，他们引导你到窗前。\让我告诉你，自从我们分开后我所做的一切。 他们急促的呼吸使玻璃蒙上了一层雾气，因为他们对你们分开的这些年进行了编造但又合理的叙述。
Boring person=无聊的人
You remember the gentleman from when you passed him in New Winchester. He had accosted you with the newspaper and an invitation to assist him with the crossword. He had many regrettable political opinions. \n\nHe is here now, and, oh look, he has brought the crossword, dated from that very day. He smiles eagerly as he hands you a sharpened pencil.=你还记得你在新温彻斯特与他擦肩而过时的那位先生。他曾拿着报纸与你搭讪，邀请你协助他做填字游戏。他有很多令人遗憾的政治观点。\他现在来了，而且，看，他带来了填字游戏，日期就在那天。他急切地笑着递给你一支削好的铅笔。
You recognise the lady as soon as you enter the room. She had been serving soup at the Round Table or some even lowlier establishment beneath the bridges of New Winchester. Had you made a cutting remark? Perhaps you were less than complimentary about the soup. \n\nWell, no matter; for here she is now, armed with tureens for you to sample. A stained bar-stool has been provided for your comfort.=你一进房间就认出了这位女士。她曾在圆桌餐厅或新温彻斯特桥下的某个更低级的机构里端过汤。你是不是说了什么难听的话？也许你对汤的评价不高。\好吧，没关系；因为她现在在这里，拿着汤锅让你品尝。为了你的舒适，还提供了一个染色的吧椅。
You think you shared a cabin with this gentleman once, on the long ride to New Winchester. A fussy gentleman with an abominable hat and a dreadful habit of correcting your grammar. He's here now, with his awful moustache and a leaden pencil. \n\nIt appears he made quite a catalogue of your vices in the short time you shared. He has developed Opinions. The door closes behind you, just as the gentleman is opening his briefcase to bring out his lists.=你认为你曾经和这位先生在去新温彻斯特的长途旅行中同住一个小屋。一位挑剔的绅士，带着一顶可恶的帽子，还有纠正你语法的可怕习惯。他现在就在这里，留着可怕的胡子，拿着铅笔。\在你们相处的短暂时间里，他似乎对你的恶习做了一个很好的记录。他已经形成了自己的观点。门在你身后关上，就在这位先生打开他的公文包拿出他的清单时。
A dreadful old woman you once snubbed at a party on New Winchester is waiting in the room. Were it not for the windows you could believe London had never risen to the stars. Victoria and the Prince Consort glower from every wall. The tea is from Fallen London, as is the conversation. \n\nShe has scrupulously avoided contact with all elements of the Wilderness. Her concerns are parochial, her interests solipsistic. She delights in regaling you with the happiness this has given her. =你曾经在新温彻斯特的一个聚会上冷落过的一个可怕的老女人正在房间里等待。如果不是因为窗户，你可以相信伦敦从未升起过星星。维多利亚和王储从每一面墙上都闪烁着光芒。茶是来自堕落的伦敦，谈话也是如此。\她小心翼翼地避免与荒野中的所有元素接触。她的关注点是狭隘的，她的兴趣是孤独的。她乐于向你讲述这给她带来的幸福。
Crewman=乘务员
Her eyes light up as you enter the room. It looks just like a bunk on your engine. She's laid out the tea, just how you liked it. When did you lose her again? Was it an accident? Did you part ways on the Isambard line? You can't remember, and she's good enough not to mention it. \n\nInstead she talks of former times, of old friends remembered, older jokes shared. It is only hours after that you remember what happened to her.=当你进入房间时，她的眼睛亮了起来。它看起来就像你发动机上的一个铺位。她摆好了茶，就像你喜欢的那样。你什么时候又失去了她？是个意外吗？你们是在伊桑巴德线上分道扬镳的吗？你不记得了，她也很好，没有提及此事。\相反，她谈到了以前的时光，谈到了记得的老朋友，分享的老笑话。几个小时后，你才想起她发生了什么。
He is waiting in the shadows of a room laid out like the mess hall of your locomotive. His fingers tremble on the railing. The rancour in his eyes is exactly as you remember. \n\nWhat did you say that day? What did you do? There is no hiding from that gaze. No illusion survives contact with the weight of that loathing. He does not speak once.=他正在一个房间的阴影中等待，这个房间布置得像你的火车头的食堂。他的手指在栏杆上颤抖着。他眼中的怨恨与你记忆中的一模一样。\你那天说了什么？你做了什么？他的目光让人无法躲避。没有任何幻想能在与这种厌恶的重量的接触中幸存下来。他一次都没有说话。
Your old companion in vice is inside, shackled in a room which resembles one of the Midnight Cells. He sighs and explains this is where all that trouble got him. \n\nHe begs you to listen to the old stories, one last time. \I couldn't have done it without you, captain,\ he says, apparently entirely sincerely. The talk seems to have cheered him up immensely. =你的老伙伴在里面，被铐在一个类似于午夜牢房的房间里。他叹了口气，解释说这是他所有麻烦的地方。\他恳求你最后一次听他讲那些老故事。\没有你我做不到，队长，他说，显然是完全真诚的。这次谈话似乎让他非常振奋。
She is waiting for you at her old desk in her cabin. She had attained a position of some seniority on your engine before circumstances severed you. \n\nShe leans forward to embrace you, before offering a green-leather seat. Her mouth quirks, accentuating the scarring on her face. \Now, I'm told you're feeling a little tired of life among the stars\=她正在她的船舱里的老办公桌前等你。在情况与你断绝关系之前，她已经在你的引擎上获得了一个有一定资历的职位。\她俯身向前拥抱你，然后提供一个绿色的皮革座位。她的嘴角微微翘起，突出了她脸上的伤痕。\Now, I'm told you're feeling a little tired of life among the stars （现在，我听说你对星星的生活感到有点厌倦）。

An engineer passes you a knife to cut the net. Behind it, items nestle against the fur. An extraordinarily detailed glass finger: perfect down to its fragile fingerprint. A wooden bottle holding clean water. A cube with the chill and edge of metal, but transparent as a window. The etched markings on each side of it are in a language you have never encountered. A dice? Finally, a stone that would make a jeweller's heart stop.=一个工程师递给你一把刀，让你割开网。在它的后面，物品依偎在毛皮上。一个特别细致的玻璃手指：完美到脆弱的指纹。一个装着干净水的木瓶。一个具有金属的寒气和边缘的立方体，但像窗户一样透明。它的每一面都有蚀刻的标记，是一种你从未遇到过的语言。一个骰子？最后，是一块能让珠宝商心跳加速的石头。
The net is so tightly bound that it takes you several minutes to work items free. The first tears as you pull: it is a letter from London; a young lady rejecting a suitor. There is a thin rod made of dense, malleable metal. Its end is tapered, with a raw edge. It has been torn off something larger. Finally, hanging out of a broken setting, a stone the size of a child's fist, that shatters your lights into rainbows.=这张网绑得很紧，你要花几分钟时间才能把物品解开。第一件物品在你拉动的过程中撕裂了：它是一封来自伦敦的信；一位年轻的女士拒绝了一位求婚者。有一根由致密的、可塑的金属制成的细棒。它的末端是锥形的，有一个原始的边缘。它被从更大的东西上撕下来。最后，从一个破碎的镶嵌物上挂出一块石头，有小孩的拳头那么大，把你的灯光震成彩虹。
The net is taut; as you begin to cut, its cords ping loose. It holds only a large jar. The things inside are dried and withered. Is that a grape? It rolls over to show a blue iris. Beneath it is a gelatinous bubble containing uncannily-stirring smoke. At the bottom is a dried stalk; one end is swollen, the skin thin and transparent. It glows and flickers like a trapped fire fly  if the fly were as bright as a star.=网是紧绷的；当你开始切割时，它的绳索乒乒乓乓地松动。它只能容纳一个大罐子。里面的东西已经干枯了。那是一颗葡萄吗？它翻转过来，露出一朵蓝色的鸢尾花。它的下面是一个胶状的气泡，里面有不稳定的烟雾。底部是一个干枯的茎；一端肿胀，皮薄而透明。它发着光，闪烁着，就像一只被困的火蝇，如果这只火蝇像星星一样明亮。
CondemnedResult=CondemnedResult
The net is fraying and easy to snap. It has been damaged by the contents  unkind things. A carnivore's tooth: thick, long and shaped to rip and gouge. The nameplate of a locomotive, blasted beyond reading, twisted and torn; its edges are raw. A perfect sphere, smooth to the touch and black as guilt. It seems out of place in this array, till you notice that your sky-suit has eroded where you held it.=这张网已经磨损，容易折断。它已被内容不善的东西损坏。一颗食肉动物的牙齿：又粗又长，形状是撕咬和抠挖的。一个机车的铭牌，被炸得无法阅读，扭曲和撕裂；其边缘是生的。一个完美的球体，触摸起来很光滑，黑得让人心虚。它在这个阵列中似乎格格不入，直到你注意到你的天空服在你拿着它的地方被侵蚀了。
The cords of the net are stained a dark rust-brown. They part reluctantly under your knife, creaking as you saw at them. There is a stone, the size of your fist and the shape of a tear. An Enfield revolver, engraved with faded initials. A tube long as your arm and thick as your thigh, hollow and smelling of sulphur. A flower with pollen acidic enough to blister steel. A rope. =网的绳索被染成了深色的锈褐色。它们在你的刀下不情愿地分开，当你看到它们时发出吱吱声。有一块石头，有你的拳头大小，形状像一滴泪。一把恩菲尔德左轮手枪，上面刻着褪色的首字母。一根和你的手臂一样长，和你的大腿一样粗的管子，空心的，有硫磺的味道。一朵花，花粉的酸性足以让钢铁起泡。一根绳子。
A maggot squirms free while you are cutting open the net. Beneath the Curator's motley collection is an unhealing wound. Blood and effluvia have encrusted its belongings. You need to wipe them down before they can be identified. There is a cast metal sort (the letter O). There is a sharpened quill, from no bird you've encountered. A pot of dust, which liquefies under pressure. (Your engineer's hands will be stained for weeks.)=当你切开网的时候，一只蛆虫蠕动了一下。在馆长杂七杂八的收藏品下面，是一个未愈合的伤口。血液和流出物已经包裹了它的物品。你需要把它们擦拭干净，才能确定它们的身份。有一个铸造的金属排序（字母O）。有一支削尖的羽毛笔，来自你没有遇到过的鸟。一盆灰尘，在压力下会液化。(你的工程师的手会被染上几个星期。)
OtherworldlyResult=其他世界的结果
The net releases a tumult of items: one small cymbal  the size of a large coin, a flower whose petals chafe to produce a crystalline hum, a rock the size of a human skull  carved into a looping shape and pierced with a lattice of tunnels, and, finally, a gourd. The gourd bulges with round-capped fungus which, when depressed, emits a wistful sighing. =这张网放出了一堆物品：一个大硬币大小的小钹，一朵花，其花瓣摩擦产生晶莹的嗡嗡声，一块人类头骨大小的岩石，被雕刻成环形，并穿有隧道的格子，最后是一个葫芦。葫芦上隆起的圆盖真菌，在压下时，发出俏皮的叹息。
The fur around the net is matted and worn; it must be torn free before you can access its contents. Among them is a chitinous foot, possessed of eight articulate toes  it smells like embalming fluid. A small dried five-eyed fish. A human heart, salted. Was this curator notably morbid? Or were these provisions for its vast, windy journeys across the gulfs between stars?=网周围的毛皮是垫高的、磨损的；在你能接触到它的内容之前，必须把它撕开。其中有一只甲壳质的脚，拥有八个有关节的脚趾，闻起来像防腐液。一条小的五眼鱼干。一颗盐渍的人类心脏。这位馆长是不是很病态？还是说这些是为它穿越星际间的海湾而提供的巨大的、多风的旅程？
The net bulges, its cords straining against its contents. When cut, the strings fly back, flicking against the glass of your helmet. The contents spew forth. This is a short rod, with a bristle of brass spines at one end. Is it a key? A plaque of adamant, stamped with a blazing sigil. It is too bright to consider directly, and melts several mirrors when you try to examine it more obliquely. Is it a passphrase? A beacon? And finally, a doorknob, as found in a typical middle-class London home. =网子鼓起来了，它的绳索对它的内容物产生了压力。当被切断时，绳索飞回，弹到你头盔的玻璃上。里面的东西就会喷出来。这是一根短棒，一端有黄铜刺的鬃毛。这是一把钥匙吗？一个金刚牌，上面印着一个炽热的符号。它太亮了，无法直接考虑，当你试图更斜地检查它时，会融化几面镜子。它是一个口令吗？一座灯塔？最后是一个门把手，在一个典型的伦敦中产阶级家庭中发现。

The Curator's wings lift away easily  they are thin, translucent and dull. Beneath them, the creature's torso is marred with a brand. It is a sigil, partially obliterated by a wound from one of your weapons. Even damaged and incomplete, it aches to look upon.=馆长的翅膀很容易就抬起来了，它们很薄，半透明，无光泽。在它们下面，这个生物的躯干上有一个烙印的痕迹。那是一个符号，被你的一个武器的伤口部分抹去了。即使被损坏和不完整，它也让人看了心疼。
An engineer offers you a crowbar to assist with the creature's wings. It is easy enough to hook it under one of the forearms, but the bone fractures when you apply force. You are forced to don a second pair of gloves to peel the wings open by the claws. =一位工程师为你提供了一根撬棍，以协助处理这个生物的翅膀。把它钩在一只前臂下很容易，但当你用力时，骨头就会断裂。你不得不戴上第二副手套，用爪子把翅膀剥开。
It takes two to pull open one of the giant wings. It is reasonably light, but cumbersome  it threatens to enfold you like an affectionate tent. You pull back the other wing. The Curator's body is still warm, and covered with a fine fur. =需要两个人才能拉开其中一个巨翼。它还算轻，但累赘的它有可能像一个亲切的帐篷一样把你包裹起来。你拉回另一只翅膀。馆长的身体仍然是温暖的，并且覆盖着一层细毛。
This creature's wings were thin and battered even before you trained your weapons upon it. They tear when you unfold them. Its body is thin, the ridges of its ribs pressing through the patchy dull fur. An old scar traces the shape of a sigil. \I can't look at it, Captain. Makes my teeth sing.\ An engineer winces and turns away.=这个生物的翅膀很薄，甚至在你对它进行武器训练之前就已经被打烂了。当你展开它们时，它们就会撕裂。它的身体很瘦，肋骨的棱线压在斑驳的暗色毛皮上。一道古老的疤痕描画出一个符号的形状。\我不能看它，队长。让我的牙齿发痒。一个工程师抽泣着转身离开。
Your weapons have wrenched one wing out of the shoulder. The Curator is covered in a fine, dull fur. Under what could perhaps be described as an armpit is a bald patch, marred with a throbbing sigil. Fortunately, the grime on your visor prevents you from seeing it clearly. Your stoker  ever fastidious  is less lucky. He shrieks as his eyebrows ignite.=你的武器把一只翅膀从肩膀上扯了下来。馆长身上覆盖着一层细密、暗淡的皮毛。在也许可以被描述为腋下的地方有一块秃头，上面有一个跳动的符号。幸运的是，你面罩上的污垢使你无法清楚地看到它。你的司炉一向很谨慎，却没有那么幸运。当他的眉毛被点燃时，他尖叫起来。
The Curator's wings are thin but sturdy, with a texture between sailcloth and supple leather. An engineer helps you pull the wings open and pin them out of the way. He yelps when a claw scratches his helmet  a final spasm from the dead creature.=馆长的翅膀很薄但很结实，质地介于帆布和柔软的皮革之间。一个工程师帮你拉开翅膀，把它们钉在外面。当一只爪子抓破他的头盔时，他大叫起来，这是死亡生物的最后一次痉挛。
The Curator's wings are thick and heavy, like the leather of a London club's best armchair. It takes the combined strength of you and your navigator to reveal the beast's torso  thick with muscle, covered in a glossy fur. This one was a skilled hunter; it ate well.=馆长的翅膀又厚又重，像伦敦俱乐部最好的扶手椅的皮革。需要你和你的领航员合力才能露出这只野兽厚实的肌肉，覆盖着一层光亮的皮毛。这只是一个熟练的猎手；它吃得很好。
Even in death, this beast exudes menace. Its fur shines oily black in the light from your locomotive. The leathery wings are scarred, but only from trivial wounds. The creature's teeth are long and serrated. One is broken and jagged, and no less dangerous for it. This sky-stalker sought and won countless battles. Then it met you.=即使在死亡中，这只野兽也散发着威胁的气息。它的皮毛在你的机车灯光下闪着油亮的黑色。皮质的翅膀上有伤痕，但只是一些微不足道的伤口。这个生物的牙齿很长，呈锯齿状。有一颗是断裂的、参差不齐的，但也不失为一种危险。这个空中漫步者寻求并赢得了无数次的战斗。然后它遇到了你。

A few of your crew are spirits of the dead=你的船员中有几个是死人的灵魂
About half your crew are spirits of the dead=大约一半的船员是亡灵
Most of your crew are spirits of the dead=你的大部分船员都是亡灵
A few of your crew are now shades of the dead.=你的几个船员现在是亡灵的影子
About half your crew are now shades of the dead.=大约一半的船员现在是死人的影子。
Most of your crew are now shades of the dead.=你的大部分船员现在都是亡灵的影子。
About half of them are now silent, masked spirits of the dead who you recruited to help staff your locomotive.=大约一半的人现在是沉默的、戴着面具的亡灵，他们被你招募来帮助你的机车工作人员。
The masked dead sit at one end of the table, the living at the other. The dead lift their masks forward to spoon food to their cold lips. The living crew are careful not to look. It's considered bad luck to glimpse the faces of the dead. You suppose new superstitions bloom quickly under these conditions.=戴面具的死者坐在桌子的一端，活人坐在另一端。死者向前掀开面具，用勺子把食物送到他们冰冷的嘴唇上。活着的船员们都小心翼翼地不看。人们认为瞥见死者的脸是不吉利的。你想，在这种情况下，新的迷信很快就会绽放。
The silence of the masked dead settles like a mantle over the table. It is contagious, stifling one conversation, then another. Is it your imagination, or are the dead paying you especially close attention this evening? Some of them have abandoned all pretence of eating. You finish your meal quickly, and return to duty.=戴着面具的死人的沉默就像桌子上的幔子一样沉淀下来。它是有传染性的，扼杀了一次谈话，然后是另一次。是你的想象力，还是死者今晚特别关注你？他们中的一些人已经放弃了所有假装吃饭的行为。你赶紧吃完饭，然后回到岗位上。
The masked dead now comprise so many of your number that some of the living crew have begun wearing masks and swearing vows of silence to fit in. It makes for a solemn, gloomy meal, the only sound the clink of cutlery on bowls and on porcelain masks.=戴面具的死人现在占了你们人数的很大一部分，以至于一些活着的船员已经开始戴上面具并发誓要保持沉默以适应环境。这使得吃饭变得庄重、阴沉，唯一的声音是餐具在碗上和瓷面具上的叮当声。
The sky-shanties are perhaps a little lubricated; the humour laced with a touch of mania. But for now, the fears of the sky are forgotten=天空中的歌声也许有点润滑；幽默中带着一丝狂热。但现在，对天空的恐惧被遗忘了
Even the masked shades serving aboard partake of the brandy. They do not sing, but they do sway, supportively=即使是船上的蒙面人也喝了白兰地酒。他们不唱歌，但他们确实在摇摆，支持着
Cracked=裂开了
Only the shades of the dead are unaffected.=只有死者的影子不受影响。
Fire1=火1

The shades in your crew have been outnumbered and locked in the hold.=你的船员中的黑影已经寡不敌众，被关在船舱里。

Over the next hour, the wounds it inflicted bloat with venom. The victims scream themselves hoarse before they die.=在接下来的一个小时里，它所造成的伤口被毒液胀破了。受害者在死前声嘶力竭地大叫。
By the time it's secured once more, the ground is littered with crushed bodies and broken masks.=当它再次被保护起来的时候，地面上到处都是被压碎的尸体和破碎的面具。
Breach1=Breach1
Your remaining crew do not appreciate having to edge past a gaping hole on their way to the galley. =你剩下的船员并不欣赏在去厨房的路上不得不从一个缺口边上经过。
The shades in your crew continue to work, walking past the hole as thought it were not there. Every day, the damage worsens.=你的船员们继续工作，走过这个洞，仿佛它不存在。每一天，损害都在恶化。
Breach2=突破2
They delayed their return for too long, and have developed a cruel case of frostbite. =他们耽误了太多的时间，已经患上了残酷的冻疮。
Their mask is brittle with frost and crumbles on return. They hide their face rather than be seen; and run from you, away into the bowels of your engine. You do not think you see them again.=他们的面具被冻得很脆，一回来就碎掉了。他们把脸藏起来，而不是被人看见；并从你身边跑开，跑到你的发动机的肠子里。你认为你不会再看到他们。
Bristol=布里斯托尔
Dust is beginning to gather on your shades.=灰尘开始在你的窗帘上聚集。
Fumes=烟尘
Even the shades appear distressed. Do the impurities in the air threaten the integrity of their souls?=就连窗帘也显得很苦恼。空气中的杂质是否威胁到他们灵魂的完整性？
Mutinydeath=叛变的死亡
Your shades remain loyal. Or, at least, they are not taking part.=你的影子仍然忠诚。或者，至少，他们没有参与。

The window frames serve as a trellis for a vine circumnavigating the signal box. The plant's stem resembles thigh-thick twine, giving the building the appearance of a hurriedly wrapped parcel.=窗框充当了环绕信号箱的藤蔓的棚架。该植物的茎像大腿粗的麻绳，使建筑物看起来像一个匆忙包装的包裹。
Window cracks have accreted a filling of moss-green dust. Once-white paint is yellowed and peeling. The signal box possesses a faded dignity, like a beleaguered butler. It was designed with pride  to be part of that great folly, the Isambard Line.=窗户的裂缝中已经积聚了苔藓绿色的灰尘。曾经的白色油漆已经发黄和剥落。信号箱拥有一种褪色的尊严，就像一个陷入困境的管家。它被自豪地设计为那个伟大的愚蠢的一部分，伊桑巴德线。
This signal box is not here. It is a memory of a dream that could not be built. You should not be here; you should not see this.=这个信号箱不在这里。它是对一个无法建成的梦想的记忆。你不应该在这里；你不应该看到这个。
This signal box has been blasted by weapon fire. Despite the holes, the shattered tiles, the fractured beams, it still has enough structural integrity for you to climb inside without risk. It was made with care, and pride.=这个信号箱已经被武器的炮火炸毁。尽管有孔洞、破碎的瓷砖、断裂的横梁，它仍然有足够的结构完整性，你可以毫无危险地爬进去。它是精心制作的，而且很自豪。
The signal box is shrouded in grey. Close up, you see that the box is covered in delicate webs, studded with cocoons. From the blue and white pattern of one bundle, it appears a spider has trapped a teapot.=信号箱被笼罩在灰色之中。近距离观察，你会发现盒子上布满了精致的网，上面缀满了蚕茧。从一束蓝白相间的图案来看，似乎是一只蜘蛛困住了一个茶壶。

The locomotive was overwhelmed with the scent of honey, and home.=船长描述了他们为到达信号箱而飞过的一片碎石地。每块岩石都迸发着生命力。牛奶色的小花在发动机的气流中颠簸着。机车被蜂蜜的香味淹没了，还有家的味道。

The captain warns of a condition afflicting her crew: it started during a period of downtime. One took up gazing at the stars, and encouraged the others into consideration of the heavens. This has since become a fixation, and the entire crew only grudgingly leaves the windows to perform their labours.=船长警告说，她的船员出现了一种状况：它是在一段停工期内开始的。一个人开始凝视星空，并鼓励其他人考虑天象。此后，这成了一种固定的习惯，全体船员只是勉强地离开窗户去做他们的工作。
The captain writes of a homestead their locomotive passed when journeying from Port Avon. The buildings were in the style of old London. The nostalgia brought the crew together, after a near disastrous encounter with a Chorister bee.=船长写道，他们的机车在从埃文港出发时经过了一个家园。这些建筑是老伦敦的风格。这种怀旧情绪使船员们走到了一起，在与一只乔里斯特蜜蜂发生了几乎灾难性的遭遇之后。

The skylarks have carved their glyphs into one of the wooden posts at the station's periphery. As you and the Vagabond approach, you find a wildly-unkempt man slumped nearby, surrounded by a small fortress of empty bottles. \n\n\You a skylark?\ asks the Vagabond.\n\n\So what if I am?\ slurs the man. \n\n\Skylarks aren't supposed to get drunk near the station,\ grumbles the Vagabond. \Gives us a bad name among the crews and the captains. It's against the Code, and I should know, because I wrote it.\=云雀在车站外围的一根木柱上刻下了他们的字迹。当你和流浪者走近时，你发现一个蓬头垢面的人瘫倒在附近，被一个小型的空瓶堡垒所包围。\你是云雀吗？流浪者问道。如果我是，那又怎样？那人啧啧称赞。\Skylarks aren't supposed to get drunk near the station, grumbles the Vagabond. \这让我们在船员和船长中名声不佳。这是违反守则的，我应该知道，因为它是我写的。
You crouch beside the post and examine the signs that have been carved down its length. \n\n\The stickman above three squares tells us that Achlys is a good place to fence stolen goods,\ translates the Vagabond, tracing signs with one filth-blackened finger. \The three lines connecting the badge and the sock means the local police are urchins. The pipe and the smiling face mean you can buy good tobacco at below-market rates.\=你蹲在柱子旁边，检查柱子上刻下的标志。\三个格子上面的棍子告诉我们，Achlys是一个销赃的好地方，流浪者翻译道，用一个脏兮兮的黑手指描画标志。\连接徽章和袜子的三条线意味着当地警察是顽童。烟斗和笑脸意味着你可以以低于市场的价格买到好烟。

Well=井
The well's tumult makes the bathysphere swing and spin. It is a rocky, nauseous descent. Soon, the last light of the stars falters, and the windows are dark. But there is movement in that dark, like ink stirred into water.\n=这口井的动荡让水球摇晃着旋转起来。这是一个充满岩石、令人作呕的下降过程。很快，星星的最后一丝光亮渐渐消失，窗外一片黑暗。但在那片黑暗中存在着运动，就像墨水被搅入水中。

They half raise themselves from their deep cushions in greeting, and bid you sit across from them. They ask how you enjoyed the show; and before you can answer, they apologise for their performance. \n\n\I'm nothing by myself,\ they say. \Without my twin there to catch me; or there to leap, for me to catch; it's quite dull. But they're trying to break themselves from the Circus again.\=他们把自己从深色的坐垫上抬起来打招呼，并请你坐在他们对面。他们问你喜欢这出戏吗？在你回答之前，他们为自己的表演表示歉意。\他们说：我一个人什么都不是，他们说。\没有我的孪生兄弟在那里接住我；或者在那里跳跃，让我接住；这是很无趣的。但他们又想把自己从马戏团里弄出来。
They do not rise from their cushion to greet you. They don't even look at you, but at a portrait behind you of them and their twin. \n\n\Come and go,\ they say. \Here one day, gone the next, but back before you know it; and so will it always go.\=他们不会从坐垫上站起来迎接你。他们甚至不看你，而是看你身后的一幅他们和他们的孪生兄弟的画像。\他们说：来了又走，走了又来。\他们说：今天来了，明天走了，但在你知道之前又回来了；而且永远都是这样。
You find them practising a handstand.

I do miss them dreadfully though.\=你发现他们在练习倒立。他们倒立着向你挥手，用一只手保持平衡，显示出惊人的力量。\他们说：我想知道他们是怎么过的。\每次我们出去，我想我们会走得更远一些。但我确实非常想念他们。

'Outrage! Calumny! Perfidy! These were the phrases that stood out most in the Bursar's Annual Report. I had some choice words for him too, as you can well imagine.

They think me eccentric, but I find their ignorance mad. Why wa,'愤怒! 诽谤! 不诚实! 这些都是会计长年度报告中最突出的短语。我也对他说了一些好话，你可以想象。我们对自己的领土知之甚少，这很荒唐。他们以前的领主可能被征服了，被打倒了，但他们的影响就像远处的星光一样明显，在叛徒森林的树枝上斑驳。他们认为我很古怪，但我觉得他们的无知很疯狂。为什么要等待

The Journal is a frustrating document, written in both terrible handwriting and a near-impenetrable code. Much of what you can painstakingly decipher is meaningless without context. Scattered phrases like 'chimeric moonlight', 'a Golden Day', and 'death in amber'. Most of all, the same phrase again and again: 'The Martyr-King's Cup.'\n\nYou study it through the night. It seems to offer no clue to the Chamberlain's whereabouts, but you feel on the verge of some other, tantalising realisation.=日记是一份令人沮丧的文件，既是用可怕的笔迹写成的，也是一种几乎无法破解的密码。你费尽心思破译的大部分内容在没有上下文的情况下是毫无意义的。散乱的短语，如'嵌合月光'、'黄金日'和'琥珀中的死亡'。最重要的是，同样的短语一次又一次：殉道者--国王的杯子。你彻夜研究它。它似乎没有提供任何关于张伯伦下落的线索，但你感到即将实现其他一些诱人的认识。

embassy_description=大使馆_描述
Hybras is a tranquil ruin. Almost empty, but not quite. As word of the Blue Kingdom's embassy has spread, a few brave souls have journeyed here in search of work or answers to their questions about death. They're working on moving furniture into the Embassy, while the Orator goads them on.=海布拉斯是一个宁静的废墟。几乎是空的，但不完全是。随着蓝色王国大使馆的消息传开，一些勇敢的人来到这里寻找工作或关于死亡问题的答案。他们正在努力把家具搬进大使馆，而演说家却在鼓动他们。
The entire town now wear blue robes, and the exhausted Orator is delivering sermons ten times a day. More pilgrims arrive daily. The air is constantly filled with hammering and sawing as new houses are built. Rival sects of the Philosophy have even begun to form, along lines so subtle only an expert can trace them.=现在全镇的人都穿上了蓝袍，疲惫不堪的演说家每天要讲十次道。每天都有更多的朝圣者到来。空气中不断充斥着锤子和锯子的声音，因为新房子正在建造。哲学的对立派别甚至已经开始形成，其路线是如此微妙，只有专家才能追踪它们。
The Philosophy has become a talking point across the Reach, and its popularity has been enticing pilgrims to the embassy. They have questions about death, and the Orator has a thousand answers. The ruined village is being rebuilt as more and more visitors decide to settle permanently.=哲学已经成为整个Reach的一个话题，它的受欢迎程度一直在吸引着朝圣者来到大使馆。他们有关于死亡的问题，而演说家有一千个答案。随着越来越多的游客决定永久定居，这个破败的村庄正在重建。
A group of musicians sit outside the Blue Kingdom embassy, singing dreamily about the Philosophy. Blue-robed artists are painting a mural on the side of the town hall, of a blue star lighting up the sky. The Orator glides among them, examining their work and praising them rapturously.=一群音乐家坐在蓝色王国大使馆外，梦幻般地唱着《哲学》。穿着蓝袍的艺术家们正在市政厅的一侧绘制壁画，画的是一颗蓝色的星星照亮了天空。演讲者在他们中间滑行，审视他们的作品，狂热地赞美他们。
The Blue Kingdom's embassy is a roaring, heaving hub of activity at the centre of a thriving town. The old houses of Hybras are no longer enough; a dozen new cottages are under construction in an attempt to meet the demand of the constant influx of new visitors. It is a town of scholars, artists, idealists, passionate believers. The Orator hosts daily debates and study groups and singalongs, all dedicated to the Philosophy.=蓝色王国的大使馆是一个蓬勃发展的城镇的中心，是一个咆哮的、涌动的活动中心。Hybras的老房子已经不够用了；一打新的小屋正在建设中，试图满足不断涌入的新游客的需求。这是一个由学者、艺术家、理想主义者、热情的信仰者组成的城镇。演说家每天都会举办辩论会、学习小组和歌唱会，都是为了哲学。
The Blue Kingdom's embassy once occupied the humble Hybras town hall, but it has been rebuilt into a grand mansion with windows of azure stained glass. Blue-robed musicians sing the praises of the Philosophy in the street. As you approach the embassy, someone thrusts a pamphlet into your hand. The Orator is in the town square, delivering a speech, cheered on by hundreds of adherents.=蓝色王国的大使馆曾经占据了简陋的Hybras市政厅，但它已被重建为一座宏伟的豪宅，窗户是天蓝色的彩色玻璃。穿着蓝袍的音乐家们在街上唱着对哲学的赞美。当你接近大使馆时，有人把一本小册子塞到你手里。演说家正在镇上的广场上发表演讲，受到数百名信徒的欢呼。
The Blue Kingdom's embassy is a bustle of activity. Most of the town hall's rooms are now occupied, the old rotten furniture has been replaced, and eager employees bustle back and forth with clipboards. The Mesmeric Orator delivers a speech twice-daily, to cheers and applause.=蓝色王国的大使馆是一个热闹的地方。市政厅的大部分房间现在都有人了，旧的腐烂的家具已经被替换，热心的员工拿着剪贴板来回忙碌。弥赛亚演说家每天发表两次演讲，引起欢呼和掌声。

It is occupied only by the Mesmeric Orator, who stands on the balcony and practices speeches to an audience of mushrooms.=Hybras是一个沉默的、被孢子侵袭的废墟。蓝色王国的大使馆已经接管了市政厅，但它几乎完全空着。它只被中医演说家占据，他站在阳台上，对着一群蘑菇观众练习演讲。

Milky tears spill over their cheeks and run into the Companion's mouth.\n\nThe Companion's leathery lips twitch, and they turn their head to you, ignoring the spirit. Stiffly at first, but with gradually more fluid movements, they sit upright upon the plinth, then step down onto the floor of the chamber. \I look forward to working for you,\ they say in a monotone voice.=精神抚摸着你的同伴的脸，因情感而颤抖。乳白色的眼泪溢出脸颊，流进同伴的嘴里。同伴的皮革般的嘴唇抽搐着，他们把头转向你，不理会这个灵魂。一开始很僵硬，但随着动作的逐渐流畅，他们在基座上坐直了，然后走到了房间的地板上。\我期待着为你工作，他们用单调的声音说。
The crumpled object on the plinth is an empty sack of leathery skin. Its head is featureless but for a mouth and two ragged holes where eyes should be.\n\nThe spirit places four neatly-labelled vessels beside the skin. Each contains a soul. The one you select will determine what your companion becomes.\n\nAs you consider your choice, the spirit stares at you. It could be an illusion, but their facial features appear to morph in the flickering light from the furnace.=基座上皱巴巴的东西是一个皮包骨头的空袋子。它的头没有特征，只有一张嘴和两个应该是眼睛的破洞。灵魂在皮囊旁边放了四个整齐的标签的容器。每个容器都包含一个灵魂。你选择的那个将决定你的同伴变成什么样子。当你考虑你的选择时，灵魂盯着你。这可能是一种幻觉，但他们的面部特征在熔炉闪烁的光线中似乎在变形。

'The work continues sporadically. It would help if London would put a bit more support behind me, rather than casting its nets where-ever it thinks it might get a bite. I was appointed as their expert. But no matter, as soon as I get my hands on the telescope again, I'll turn my attentions back to our enemy in Azure.'='工作零星地继续着。如果伦敦能在我身后给予更多的支持，而不是在它认为可能上钩的地方撒网，那会有帮助。我被任命为他们的专家。不过没关系，一旦我再次拿到望远镜，我就会把注意力转回到我们在阿兹尔的敌人身上。
'Incandescent fire on the horizon. A warning? A welcome? Sometimes I think they speak in sigils to confound us. Dolton has proved useless, as ever. Perhaps I shall make a pyre of his books and use the ashes to draw the Correspondence in my notes. All this is to say, the heavens remain an enigma, searing, splendid, and sibylline.'='地平线上的白炽灯火。是警告？是欢迎？有时我觉得他们用符号说话来迷惑我们。多尔顿已经证明是无用的，像以前一样。也许我应该把他的书烧掉，用灰烬来画出我笔记中的对应关系。所有这一切都意味着，天堂仍然是一个谜，灼热的、灿烂的、同义的。
'A breakthrough! I worked late into the night, burning every candle to keep myself warm  The budget can spare it, and d__n the Bursar. There are gaps between the stars, where stars once were. This must be the origination of the Discordance. Our enemies maneuver, out there in the cold and dark, and conspire against itself. But the Azure, the enemy at the Gate, has not turned its gaze away. I feel its light like breath on my neck, I feel its Law. It hates us. I must warn London to only send astronomers whose usage of hours is moderate in future.'='一个突破! 我工作到深夜，燃烧每一根蜡烛，让自己保持温暖 预算可以腾出来，而法务局也可以。星星之间有空隙，那里曾经是星星。这一定是 不和谐 的起源。我们的敌人操纵着，在寒冷和黑暗中，阴谋反对自己。但是蔚蓝，门前的敌人，并没有把它的目光移开。我感觉到它的光像呼吸一样在我的脖子上，我感觉到它的法律。它憎恨我们。我必须警告伦敦，今后只派那些使用时间适中的天文学家。
'I was commended at graduation for my tenacity, my nerve, and my lack of imagination. I find myself returning to those virtues more and more lately. I have ordered the telescope directed entirely at the azure. We feel the full force of its glare. I see shades, spirits, phantasms. Sometimes, I think I am being toyed with. Just the other night, I awoke to a beam of blue starlight, right over the scope. I crept out there, and stood, alone, on the edge of night. I felt judgement. All that I am could be boiled to atoms and scattered to the farthest edges of the horizon, and still it would pursue me until not even the wind dares howl my name. And once I am less than the smallest molecule of dust, it would forget me utterly, its attention fixed on some grander design. This is the nature of our enemy.'='我在毕业典礼上因我的坚韧、胆量和缺乏想象力而受到赞扬。我发现自己最近越来越多地回归到这些美德。我已下令将望远镜完全对准天蓝色。我们感受到了它的全部威力。我看到了阴影，精神，幻觉。有时，我觉得我被玩弄了。就在前天晚上，我被一束蓝色的星光惊醒，就在望远镜上方。我蹑手蹑脚地走到那里，独自站在夜的边缘。我感到被审判了。我的一切可以被煮成原子，散落到地平线最远的边缘，而它仍然会追寻我，直到连风都不敢嚎叫我的名字。而一旦我变成最小的尘埃分子，它就会完全忘记我，它的注意力固定在一些更伟大的设计上。这就是我们敌人的本性。

Not many can say that.\=我来自哪里？你会问每个人这个问题吗？航海家笑了，他只是在调侃。\不，我明白。这是口音问题，不是吗？我是Empyrean人，但我的英语是伦敦人的。我在那里长大。在伦敦为帝国大使工作。他直起身子，很自豪。\我的主人谈判了导致渴求之地平线开业的交易。没有多少人可以这么说。
\That was kind of you, Captain. I had hoped that having someone speak for me, show what I've made of myself, would help. Glad it wasn't needed, of course. But you were there in case it was.\\n\nHe touches your arm. \I value that.\=你真好，船长。我曾希望有人为我说话，展示我自己的成就，会有帮助。当然，很高兴不需要这样做。但你在那里，以防万一。他抚摸着你的手臂。\我很重视这个。

They're as battle-ready as they'll ever be. Lead us to the fight and we'll give you our all.\=我们接近了吗？需要我在我的岗位上吗？导航员的眼睛很亮，他正准备战斗。\当你问起船员的情况时，他的回答是有准备的。\我刚刚查过了，船长。他们已经做好了战斗准备，就像以前一样。带我们去战斗吧，我们会全力以赴的。
\Oh, Captain! That was something.\ The Navigator is filled with nervous energy; he paces across his cabin. \n\n\My friend saw the whole thing  he watched from here. Saw us besting a creature vaster than us, more ancient, more experienced in surviving the inky expanse. We came together as a crew and were victorious. Truly, we are as any noble warrior.\\n\nHe catches your eye and looks slightly abashed. \The crew fought well, Captain. That deserves recognition.\=哦，船长！那是个好东西。导航员充满了紧张的能量；他在他的船舱里踱步。\我的朋友看到了整个过程，他从这里看着。他看到我们战胜了比我们更强大的生物，更古老，更有经验的人，能在漆黑的大地上生存。我们作为一个团队走到一起并取得了胜利。真的，我们就像任何高贵的战士一样。他吸引了你的目光，看起来有点羞愧。\船员们打得很好，船长。这值得肯定。
\Come in!\ The Navigator has put his well-thumbed book of the 'Epic of King Gesar' to one side. He is mid-way through 'Scheherazade, or the One Thousand and One Nights'. He places a bookmark in it, and stands to greet you.\n\n\Is there anything you miss, from before we came through? I always thought it would be the food. But it's not that. It's the stories. Before, when I read these, they needed magic to be real. Here... so much happens, they are more like someone's journal.\ He shrugs. \They're still exciting. But not the same.\=请进！ 航海家把他那本熟读的《格萨尔王史诗》放在一边。他正在阅读《谢赫拉扎德，或一千零一夜》的中途。他在书上放了一个书签，然后站起来迎接你。在我们来之前，你有什么想念的东西吗？我一直以为会是食物。但不是那样。而是那些故事。以前，当我读这些故事时，它们需要魔法才能成为现实。这里......发生了这么多事，它们更像是某人的日记。他耸耸肩。\它们仍然令人激动。但不一样。
\Good to see you, Captain.\ The Navigator's friend still sits by the window. A pillow has been placed behind his head, and a book is balanced on his lap. \n\nThe Navigator catches your glance. \Thought I'd make him comfortable. Didn't know how long it would be till we found this magician, and his tiger.\ He blushes. \I haven't, ah, told the crew what we're looking for. My work needs their respect. I don't want them to think me silly.\=很高兴见到你，船长。 导航员的朋友仍然坐在窗边。一个枕头被放在他的脑后，一本书在他的腿上平衡。\航海家注意到了你的目光。\Thought I'd make him comfortable. 不知道还要多久才能找到这个魔术师和他的老虎。 他脸红了。\我还没有，啊，告诉船员们我们要找的东西。我的工作需要他们的尊重。我不想让他们觉得我很傻。
\Oh!\ The Navigator hadn't responded to your knock; you'd been forced to let yourself in. He has moved his friend from the window, and was staring out of it in a reverie. \Did I thank you, Captain? For the big cat?\ \n\nHe's quiet for a long while. \Do you think all cats have that duality? That they contain two beings?\ He turns to you. \Sometimes I feel like I'd have to be two people to meet the promises I made my friend. I still have to try, though. Because I love him. I have to try.\=Oh! 导航员没有回应你的敲门，你被迫让自己进来。他已经把他的朋友从窗口移开，并在遐想中盯着窗外。\我感谢你吗，船长？为了那只大猫？ \他沉默了很久。\你认为所有的猫都有这种双重性吗？它们包含两种生命？ 他转向你。\有时我觉得我必须成为两个人，才能实现我对朋友的承诺。不过，我仍然要尝试。因为我爱他。我必须要尝试。
The Navigator reports on the crew the moment you enter. \I  haven't told them I requested we visit Death's Door. They wouldn't thank me. But they have noticed a change, despite my efforts. A stoker said I seemed 'determined'. 'Calmer'. That sounds like a good thing.\n\n\There's something relaxing about having made a decision.\ He smiles fondly as he looks towards his friend, currently lying in his bunk. \No matter what it is.\=航海家 在你进来的那一刻就报告了船员的情况。\我还没有告诉他们我要求我们去参观死亡之门。他们不会感谢我。但他们已经注意到了一种变化，尽管我很努力。一个锅炉工说我看起来'坚定'。'更冷静'。这听起来是件好事。做了决定之后，有种放松的感觉。 他深情地笑着看向他的朋友，他现在正躺在他的床铺上。\No matter what it is. （不管是什么）
\Please, come in.\ The Navigator is quiet, and focused. He responds to your questions formally, providing concise and accurate details of the state of the crew and the engine. He steers away from anything about himself. \n\nAs you leave, he meets your eye. \Does Death's Door wait for us all? I have to hope not. It's almost enough to make me devout, if it would give me a choice.\,Please, come in. 请进。 导航员很安静，也很专注。他正式地回答你的问题，提供船员和发动机状况的简明而准确的细节。他对有关自己的事情避而不谈。\当你离开时，他与你的目光相遇。\死亡之门是否在等待我们所有人？我不得不希望不是。这几乎足以让我变得虔诚，如果它能给我一个选择的话。
\I'm settling in nicely, thank you. You've a good crew here. And a sharp one. They've already realised it's wise not to bet against me at cards.\ \n\nHe grins. \They demanded I stop being easy on them. They can tell when I aim to lose. I'm not an excellent liar.\=我在这里安顿得很好，谢谢你。你这里有一个很好的团队。而且是个敏锐的人。他们已经意识到在牌桌上不和我打赌是明智的。\他笑了。\他们要求我不要对他们太客气。他们能看出我的目的是要输。我不是一个优秀的说谎者。
\Have you ever made a promise, certain at the time you wouldn't be able to keep it? I've been thinking about it, ethically.\ There's a small pile of philosophy books by his bed. He must have found them at last port.\n\n\I swore to my friend, so that he could die happy. Would he really mind if I failed him? I don't think that matters. He always trusted me. I couldn't live with letting him down.\\n\nIt seems like your First Officer will not be able to focus until he has been to Eagle's Empyrean.=你有没有做过一个承诺，当时确定你不能遵守它？我一直在思考这个问题，从道德角度来说。他的床边有一小堆哲学书。他一定是在最后一个港口找到了它们。我向我的朋友发誓，这样他就可以快乐地死去。如果我让他失望，他真的会介意吗？我认为这并不重要。他总是信任我。我不能忍受让他失望。看来你的大副在去过鹰之国之前是无法集中精力的。
\Are we making progress to Lustrum, Captain?\ The Navigator is eager, but not anxious. \I am not eager to part with my oldest friend, but I've made a decision. The time has come to move on.\\n\nHe is calmer than you have seen him. When you ask why, he is straightforward. \I've decided to believe that you can earn your own death. I will grant my friend the burial he deserves, then will live the best life I can.\ He laughs. \It was that, or to go mad.\=我们在前往Lustrum方面有进展吗，船长？。导航员很急切，但并不焦急。\我并不急于与我的老朋友分开，但我已经做了一个决定。他比你见过的人更冷静。当你问及原因时，他直言不讳。\我决定相信你可以赢得你自己的死亡。我将给予我的朋友他应得的安葬，然后将过上我能过的最好的生活。 他笑了。\It was that, or to go mad.\It was that, or to go mad.
\Are we making progress to a Weft, Captain?\ The Navigator is eager, but not anxious. \I am not eager to part with my oldest friend, but I've made a decision. The time has come to move on.\\n\nHe is calmer than you have seen him. When you ask why, he is straightforward. \I've decided to believe that you can earn your own death. I will grant my friend the burial he deserves, then will live the best life I can.\ He laughs. \It was that, or to go mad.\=Are we making progress to a Weft, Captain？ 导航员很急切，但并不着急。\I am not eager to part with my oldest friend, but I've made a decision. 他比你见过的人更冷静。当你问及原因时，他直言不讳。\我决定相信你可以赢得你自己的死亡。我将给予我的朋友他应得的安葬，然后将过上我能过的最好的生活。 他笑了。\It was that, or to go mad.\It was that, or to go mad.
The Navigator begins with a run down of the state of the crew. It is both concise, and thorough. He requests an update of your own status  that he might assist were you indisposed. Work done, he relaxes.\n\n\Are you fond of poker, Captain? I hear a game has been arranged for after the shift change. We could join in. It would be interesting to see whether my luck holds.\n\n\Otherwise, of course, if you wanted to take the engine exploring, I'm ready to plot a course. I'm up for any adventure.\ Did he actually wink?=航海家 一开始就介绍了船员们的状况。它既简明又彻底。他要求更新你自己的状态，如果你不舒服，他可以协助。工作完成后，他放松了。你喜欢打扑克吗，船长？我听说有人安排在换班后进行比赛。我们可以加入进来。看看我的运气是否还在，这很有意思。否则，当然，如果你想带着引擎去探险，我已经准备好了，可以制定一个路线。我愿意接受任何冒险。他真的眨眼了吗？
The house is small, but is in an expensive location. It is well-kept: the windows are clean, the steps freshly swept. Asphodel is flourishing in an urn by the steps.\n\n\It still feels like home.\ The Navigator gazes at the front door. \It feels strange to know I'm just visiting.\=房子很小，但位于一个昂贵的位置。它保养得很好：窗户很干净，台阶刚扫过。台阶旁的骨灰盒里盛放着阿斯帕德花。它仍然有家的感觉。 导航员注视着前门。\It feels strange to know I'm just visiting. 感觉很奇怪，我只是来看看。
The Grieving Matriarch is determined you'll join her for tea. She even refuses to let the servants assist. She is rushing towards the kitchen when the Navigator intervenes.\n\n\We can't stay long. I mustn't impose on the captain. I promise I'll come back soon.\ He draws the Matriarch close, and lowers his voice. \I came to ask... May I borrow the key? I haven't been able to pay my respects.\ \n\nThe Grieving Matriarch looks mortified.=悲伤的族长决定让你和她一起喝茶。她甚至拒绝让仆人协助。当导航员介入时，她正匆匆忙忙地走向厨房。我们不能呆太久。我不能给船长添麻烦。我保证我很快就会回来的。他把母系氏族拉近，并压低了声音。\我是来问... 我能借用一下钥匙吗？我还没来得及表示敬意。\悲伤的女族长看起来很羞愧。
Magician=魔术师
\I've surpassed my father, you know. And he could fill Mahogany Hall.\ She pats the Navigator's arm. \I'm certainly the only person who could do this as cheaply, and with as few accoutrements.\n\n\In fact, I only need one more thing.\ She beams and looks at you, expectantly.=我已经超越了我的父亲，你知道的。而他可以填满桃花心木大厅。她拍了拍航海家的手臂。\我肯定是唯一一个能以如此便宜的方式做这件事的人，而且只需要很少的装饰品。事实上，我只需要一件东西。她笑了，期待地看着你。
Miss Peppercorn stands by the brass framed mirror. While she waits for you to procure a cat, she practices sleight of hand. \n\nShe is currently making a cane appear from thin air. The ease with which she makes it appear and disappear is in marked contrast to her fumbles as she tries to twirl it dramatically.=佩珀恩小姐站在铜镜边上。当她在等你去买一只猫的时候，她在练习手势。\她目前正在使一根手杖凭空出现。她让手杖出现和消失的轻松程度与她试图大幅度旋转手杖时的摸索形成了明显的对比。
Chat1=聊天1
\I'm settling in nicely, thank you, Captain. You've a good crew here. And a sharp one.\ The Navigator already has visited every crewmember at their station.=我很好地适应了，谢谢你，船长。你这里有一个很好的船员。而且是一个聪明的人。导航员已经在他们的岗位上拜访了每个船员。
The Navigator takes his feet off his desk when you enter his cabin. He's been reading the Epic of King Gesar. \I always could get lost in it. Now, rereading it feels... more important.\=当你进入他的船舱时，导航员把他的脚从桌子上拿开。他一直在读《格萨尔王史诗》。\我总是能迷失在其中。现在，重读它感觉......更重要了。
The Navigator doesn't react when you knock. When you enter without permission, he apologises. \Sorry, Captain. I was thinking.\=当你敲门时，航海家没有任何反应。当你未经允许进入时，他就会道歉。\对不起，船长。我在思考。
The Navigator takes his feet off his desk when you enter his cabin. He's been reading. \I didn't realise how much I missed reading.\=当你进入他的船舱时，导航员把他的脚从桌子上拿开。他一直在阅读。\I didn't realise how much I missed reading.
The Navigator is sitting at his desk. He holds up the Epic of King Gesar. \I've been reading it aloud to Altan. Figured it was finally my turn.\=航海家正坐在他的书桌前。他举着《格萨尔王史诗》。\我一直在给阿尔坦朗读它。我想终于轮到我了。
The Navigator is sitting on his bunk  it's the only available seat. He holds up the Epic of King Gesar. \I've been reading it to Altan. Figured it was finally my turn.\=航海家正坐在他的铺位上，这是唯一的空位。他举着《格萨尔王史诗》。\我一直在给阿尔坦读它。我想终于轮到我了。

A second thought: to whom, in this event, would the spiders pray?'='有一些古老的祈祷者。有一天晚上我在想这个问题，当时我在望远镜前，独自一人。其他懒惰的讨厌鬼早就睡了。我凝视着上面，星星们躺在它们的网里，就像苍蝇在丝线上旋转，但谁吃它们呢？什么样的蜘蛛可能会爬上什么可怕的腿，在天上爬来爬去，像线一样挂在对应的地方，离它们的白炽灯肉越来越近了。但是，当然，没有这样的蜘蛛。除非它们被引进。而蜘蛛是如何繁殖的，为什么，它们会产卵！？第二个想法：在这种情况下，蜘蛛会向谁祈祷呢？

BaseCamp=BaseCamp
The fire is low, fuelled only by damp twigs and the occasional monograph when someone thinks the others arent looking. The scholars cast mournful glances between the trees, ignoring their sodden equipment and dwindling supplies.=火堆很低，只有潮湿的树枝和偶尔有人认为别人没在看时的专著作为燃料。学者们在树间投以哀伤的目光，无视他们沾满泥土的装备和不断减少的供应。
The camp is abuzz with activity. Errant young medievalists flood the grove, busying themselves erecting tents and arguing the finer points of the ablative case. The Dismal Paleographer looks almost happy, lecturing his new flock on the principles of Chivalry and Feudalism. The Vituperative Classicist glowers by the fire. The Feckless Theologian looks tremendously put out.=营地里热闹非凡。流浪的年轻中世纪学者涌入小树林，忙着搭建帐篷，争论ablative case的细微之处。糟糕的古文字学家看起来很高兴，向他的新羊群讲授骑士精神和封建主义的原则。厌恶的古典学家在火堆旁发呆。无精打采的神学家看起来非常沮丧。
Young classicists in all manner of improbable costumes parade about the fire, sharing amphorae of wine, and quoting the worst bits of Catullus. The Vituperative Classicist charges about the place, correcting translations and cutting down theories. She is enormously enjoying herself. The Dismal Paleographer and the Feckless Theologian shiver by the fire, pointedly ignoring each other.=年轻的古典主义者穿着各种不可能的服装在火堆旁游行，分享一壶酒，并引用卡图卢斯最糟糕的部分。挑剔的古典主义者在这一带收费，纠正译文，砍掉理论。她非常享受自己。沮丧的古文字学家和无能的神学家在火堆旁发抖，尖锐地忽略了对方。
The camp is alive with plainsong. Hymns sound through the incense-choked trees. Young theologians have converged on Traitor's Wood, debating the respective merits of Boethius and Aquinas. The Feckless Theologian is in the thick of the activity, providing wine and commentaries on the most daring heresies. The Vituperative Classicist and the Dismal Theologian sit at opposite ends of the camp, scowling at their gathered piles of evidence.=营地里充满了平原的歌声。赞美诗在香火缭绕的树丛中响起。年轻的神学家们聚集在叛徒之林，争论波爱修和阿奎那各自的优点。无能的神学家在活动中，提供酒和对最大胆的异端邪说的评论。厌恶的古典主义者和厌恶的神学家坐在营地的两端，对他们收集的证据堆皱眉头。
The camp is deserted. A cold wind blows the ashes off the campfire. A few torn pages from a monograph, remorselessly scribbled over, are torn away. A nightingale calls from somewhere in the dark wood. Rain is beginning to fall, washing away the detritus left behind.=营地已经荒废了。一阵冷风吹走了篝火上的灰烬。一本专著的几页被撕掉了，被无情地涂抹着。一只夜莺从黑暗的树林里的某个地方叫着。雨开始下了，冲走了留下的残渣。
It is good to have another face about. I am heartily sick to death of that pair, and not for the first time. They are convinced of such utter rot. Any fool could tell you that this forest is the resting place of Charlemagne. Every legend and romance Ive read convinces me of it.=能有另一张面孔是件好事。我由衷地厌恶那对夫妇，这不是第一次了。他们对这种彻底的腐败深信不疑。任何傻瓜都可以告诉你，这片森林是查理曼大帝的安息之地。我读过的每一个传说和罗曼史都让我相信这一点。
Ghastly, isnt it? Ive never been able to abide classicists. Theyre entirely dogmatic about their Latin, and have never read anything besides Homer and Virgil. And shes holding court, of course. Just like back when - well. But surely you can see its all for nothing? Theres absolutely no way Inanna is here. After all, the whole ruddy point of the legend is she gets up again!=太可怕了，不是吗？我一直无法忍受古典主义者。他们对自己的拉丁文完全是教条式的，除了荷马和维吉尔，他们从来没有读过任何东西。当然，她也在开庭。就像当年一样--好吧。但你肯定能看到这一切都毫无意义？伊南娜绝对不可能在这里。毕竟，这个传说的全部要点是她会再次站起来！
This is intolerable. If theyre not butchering poor Aquinas, theyre drinking themselves senseless. And I cannot imagine the nerve of that - that creature - to lecture anyone on sin and virtue! Leave them alone with enough wine, and theyll soon forget all about Saint John and the barrow. Thats the whole problem with theology - it doesnt have to prove anything!=这是不可容忍的。如果他们不是在屠杀可怜的阿奎那，他们就是在喝得酩酊大醉。我无法想象那个--那个生物--有多大的胆量来给任何人讲授罪与德！让他们独自一人喝足够的酒，然后让他们自己来。让他们单独喝足够的酒，他们很快就会忘掉圣约翰和马车的事。这就是神学的全部问题--它不需要证明什么！
You see the dividends our work has produced! I have students of my own! Stipends! Grants! Though - between you and me - the College has not sent its best. And not nearly enough funds to cover further exploration. But we are making progress. My Charlemagne will be woken soon enough. And you shall have the credit of helping me find him.=你看到我们的工作所产生的红利了吧！我有自己的学生了！。我也有自己的学生了! 津贴! 补助金! 虽然--在你和我之间--学院没有派出最好的。也没有足够的资金来支付进一步的探索。但我们正在取得进展。我的查理曼很快就会被唤醒。而你将拥有帮助我找到他的功劳。
Weve been here positively months and have nothing to show for it. Were all but out of funds. Ive done my bit, making sure the other two can never be taken seriously again  - but weve no money for supplies for ventures into the wood. We believe the barrow is the resting place of a legendary monarch. We just cant agree on which.=我们已经在这里呆了好几个月了，却没有任何进展。我们几乎没有资金了。我已经做了我的工作，确保另外两个人再也不会被认真对待--但我们没有钱为进入森林的冒险活动提供物资。我们相信这个荒冢是一位传奇君主的安息之地。我们只是不同意哪一个。
You know I hold you responsible for this sepulchral bacchanalia. She sniffs. God, medievalists. Never seen so many corpses still walking about, and Ive been to the Tomb-Colonies thrice. I simply cannot bear to see that fourth rate practitioner of a third rate discipline triumph.=你知道我认为你应该对这个墓穴的狂欢负责。她嗅了嗅。天啊，中世纪的人。从未见过这么多的尸体还在走动，而我已经去过三次古墓区。我简直不忍心看到那四流的三流学科的实践者取得胜利。
It's good to see you! Your work in the woods has borne fruit. Summerset has sent me students - and funds - though, of course, not enough to mount another expedition. But that theyre willing to invest at all suggests theyre intrigued by what Im - were - finding here. We shall find her, you and I, and her songs will sound in the heavens again.=很高兴见到你！你在森林里的工作得到了证实。你在森林里的工作已经取得了成果。萨默塞特给我送来了学生--和资金--虽然，当然，还不足以再进行一次远征。但他们愿意投资，说明他们对我在这里的发现很感兴趣。我们将找到她，你和我，她的歌声将再次响彻天堂。
Must he carry on so ridiculously? Well, of course he must. God forbid restraint ever enter his stupid head. Theyre all prim and proper now,  of course, these awful milk and wafer students  but I know a bacchanal in the making when I see one.=他必须这样荒唐地继续下去吗？嗯，他当然必须这样。上帝保佑，不要让他的愚蠢的脑袋里有任何约束。当然，他们现在都很正经，这些可怕的牛奶和威化饼学生，但我一看到他们就知道他们在搞狂欢。
Thank Christ. Someone new. Weve been trying to reach that tomb on the hill for positively forever. Its on the far side of the wood, and were rather strapped for cash. Summersets refusing to send us a penny more for another expedition. They did not appreciate my last monograph. Apparently I brought infamy to the college. I was merely reflecting on our student days.=感谢上帝。新来的人。我们一直在试图到达山上的那个墓穴，实际上已经很久了。它在树林的另一边，而且我们的资金相当紧张。萨默塞特拒绝再给我们寄一分钱来进行另一次探险。他们并不欣赏我的最后一篇专著。显然，我给学院带来了恶名。我只是在反思我们的学生时代。
If another snot-nosed professor emeritus in the making explains to me the origin of St Johns cult in Milan, I shall scream. I shall be so cross if hes right. Although I must say, it's been nice to hear him singing the Song of Roland again. He has a very nice voice, and that was one of his favourites, once.=如果另一个流着鼻涕的名誉教授向我解释米兰的圣约翰崇拜的起源，我会大叫。如果他是对的，我就会很生气。虽然我必须说，能再次听到他唱《罗兰之歌》已经很不错了。他的声音很好听，而且那是他的最爱之一，曾经。
Im glad someones decided to talk to me, at least. Im waiting to see how long itll take her acolytes to realise how pig-headed she is. If I have to hear another lecture on the similarities between the greek heroes and the saints, however, I shall scream and scream until Saint John gets out of his grave by himself.=我很高兴有人决定和我说话，至少。我在等着看她的信徒们要花多长时间才能意识到她是多么的猪头。然而，如果我不得不再听一次关于希腊英雄和圣徒之间的相似性的讲座，我就会大喊大叫，直到圣约翰自己从他的坟墓里出来。
Summersets been so excited by our findings theyve sent me students! And a little money   for their upkeep  and for an a proper study of our findings. Not enough for another expedition, of course. Too much material evidence frightens them. The Dean was an archaeologist, I think. He has quite a horror for it now. =Summersets对我们的发现非常兴奋，他们给我送来了学生！。还有一点钱用于他们的生活和对我们的发现进行适当的研究。当然，这还不足以进行另一次探险。太多的物质证据让他们感到害怕。我想，院长是一位考古学家。他现在对它有相当大的恐惧。
The Wood=森林
The Wood is vast and dark. Its silences are split by only the occasional downpour of rain from a passing stellar drift. Heavy firs bend in the wind. The Regents Grave broods over the forest from its high place.=森林是巨大而黑暗的。它的寂静只被路过的恒星漂流中偶尔的倾盆大雨所分割。沉重的枞树在风中弯曲。摄政王墓从它的高处俯瞰着森林。
A bell sounds in the wood. The scent of incense and lotus carries with the breeze. The bronze of the Regents Grave shines in reflected starlight.=森林中响起了钟声。清香和莲花的香味随着微风飘来。摄政王墓的青铜器在反射的星光下闪闪发光。
Tall cedars bend before a fierce wind. The scent of sand carries from a nearby riverbed. The bulk of the Regents Grave casts long golden shadows across the brooding wood.=高大的雪松在猛烈的风中弯曲。沙子的香味从附近的河床传来。摄政王墓的主体在阴沉的树林中投下了长长的金色阴影。
Dark trees shrouded in snow sway in fierce winds. A horn sounds deep in the wood. The stones of the Regents Grave are dark like slate stained with the blood of felled kings.=笼罩在雪中的黑暗树木在猛烈的风中摇摆。树林深处响起了号角。摄政王墓的石头像石板一样黝黑，沾满了被砍死的国王的血。

The attendant sighs as you go over her lines together. \I don't even know what a baronet is.\ She frowns. \Some kind of root vegetable?\=当你们一起看她的台词时，服务员叹了口气。\I don't even know what a baronet is. 我甚至不知道什么是男爵。 她皱起了眉头。\Some kind of root vegetable?（某种根茎类蔬菜）
The face powder the attendant is using is cloying. He flexes his shoulders, cracking each knuckle in his hands. \The pay was worse in the Parlour but the work easier. I don't know how many more long-lost sons I've got in me.\=服务员用的面粉很腻人。他弯曲他的肩膀，敲击他手中的每个指关节。\The pay was worse in the Parlour but the work easier. 我不知道我身上还有多少个失散多年的儿子。
Two attendants ask you to juggle with them. \I think our client was one of three. Gotta keep the movements precise; now move your wrist a bit. No! Ah, yes. Like that!\ They take deep breaths and face each other like a harlequin before a mirror. \Ready?\=两个服务员请你和他们一起玩杂耍。\我想我们的客户是三个中的一个。必须保持动作的精确性；现在移动一下你的手腕。No! Ah, yes. Like that! 他们深呼吸，像镜子前的哈雷克一样面对对方。\准备好了吗？
The attendant finishes applying the brush to her wig. \I don't suppose you're familiar with Her Majesty personally? No?\ She quirks an eyebrow in her mirror. \Ah well. I don't suppose tonight's client is either. How amusing.\=服务员给她的假发刷完了。\I don't suppose you're familiar with Her Majesty personally? No? 她对着镜子挑了挑眉毛。\啊，好吧。我想今晚的客人也不认识。How amusing.\
\'And let me not be wrong about you.'\ The attendant frowns as she finishes her line reading. \But she was. He never came back for her.\ She bunches her hand into a fist before shaking it out. \And now I get to go and play the salve for his guilt.\=And let me not be wrong about you. 让我不要看错你。 服务员在读完她的台词后皱起了眉头。\但她是。他再也没有回来找过她。她把自己的手握成拳头，然后把它摇出来。\And now I get to go and play the salve for his guilt. 而现在我得去为他的罪恶感涂抹药膏。
The backrooms are a bustle of activity; frenetic and frantic, everyone powdering their faces or adjusting costumes in time for the first shift of the day.=后面的房间热闹非凡；狂热而疯狂，每个人都在给自己的脸涂脂抹粉，或者及时调整服装，以迎接今天的第一班。
Drinks=饮料
An attendant dressed as Ellen Terry shares a brandy with you by the great fireplace. The flickering firelight gleams in the surrounding stained glass. She raises her glass in a toast. \To all we could be.\=一个打扮成艾伦-泰瑞的服务员在大壁炉旁与你分享白兰地。闪烁的火光在周围的彩色玻璃上闪闪发光。她举起酒杯敬酒。\为我们可能成为的一切。
A beautiful attendant provides you with as much sherry as you could ever ask for. It soon becomes apparent they are looking for as much information on skyfaring as they're able. You give as much as time and sherry allow.=一个美丽的服务员为你提供了你想要的很多雪利酒。很快就可以看出，他们正在寻找尽可能多的关于空中飞行的信息。在时间和雪利酒允许的情况下，你给予了尽可能多的信息。
You watch attendants drift in and out of the room, bearing glasses, costumes, props, bottles, and postures. Some come to speak with you, others watch, noting your bearing, your habits, your mannerisms. No doubt some of you will remain here, repeated, in these stained glass chambers of the heart.=你看着服务员从房间里飘进飘出，带着杯子、服装、道具、瓶子和姿势。有些人前来与你交谈，有些人则在一旁观看，注意到你的举止、你的习惯和你的举止。毫无疑问，你们中的一些人将留在这里，重复着，在这些彩色玻璃的心房里。
Chequers and whiskey are the order of the day. A tournament is organised. Good whiskey for wins, bad for forfeits, extra shifts for losses, excepting yourself, of course. Your penalty is to do the washing up. The afternoon passes in a pleasant haze.=棋牌室和威士忌是今天的主旋律。组织了一场比赛。赢了就喝好的威士忌，输了就喝坏的，输了就加班，当然，你自己除外。你的惩罚是洗衣服。下午在一片愉快的朦胧中过去了。

You share a bottle of Wilderness-chilled wine with a troupe of attendants, fresh from a circus performance. \They expect us to keep up with Polmear and Plenty's!\ one tired amateur acrobat complains. \n\n\Should we ask our Host for an instructor?\ an exhausted Strongwoman asks. \n\nA grey-faced magician shakes his head. \This job. Do we need to have experienced everything to be anyone?\=你和一群刚从马戏团演出回来的服务员分享一瓶野性的冰镇葡萄酒。\一个疲惫的业余杂技演员抱怨说：他们希望我们能跟上Polmear和Plenty的步伐！。\我们应该向主人要一个教练吗？一个疲惫不堪的女强人问道。\A grey-faced magician shakes his head. \这份工作。我们需要经历一切才能成为任何人吗？

This perfumed haven was intended for thinkers, artists, philosophers and poets. Instead, you enter its main dome to find yourself surrounded by arguing Bohemians and the unfinished shells of buildings in a variety of styles. Nobody looks happy, but everyone agrees it's someone else's fault. =这个芳香的天堂是为思想家、艺术家、哲学家和诗人准备的。相反，你进入它的主穹顶，发现自己被争吵的波西米亚人和各种风格的建筑的未完成的外壳所包围。没有人看起来很高兴，但每个人都同意这是别人的错。
Titania has become a little slice of nature's glory in the Reach. Pure water flows up from the lower petals and around Valentine Square, descending again in tinkling streams that never run dry.=泰坦尼亚 已经成了 河口 地区自然界的一小片荣光。纯净的水从较低的花瓣流上来，在瓦伦丁广场周围，又在叮叮当当的溪流中下降，永远不会干涸。
Little remains of the port now that the Hive has departed. The crystal domes are cracked. The buildings beneath them lie in ruins. Survivors pick through the rubble for salvage, while a philosopher proclaims on the nature of destruction and rebirth. The more practical poets glare daggers in their direction as they attempt to rebuild.=现在蜂巢已经离开了，港口几乎没有留下什么。水晶圆顶已经开裂。它们下面的建筑成了废墟。幸存者在废墟中捡拾残骸，而一位哲学家则宣称破坏和重生的本质。更加实际的诗人在试图重建时向他们的方向瞪着匕首。

The unused buildings of Bloom Bower are the new foundation for the Titania Museum, though its purpose has yet to be agreed. The Rhapsodic Mayor practically dances through the stonework, mentally drawing up floor plans and planning decorative touches in brass and bronze.=布鲁姆鲍尔的闲置建筑是泰坦尼亚博物馆的新基础，尽管其目的还没有达成一致。狂想曲市长几乎是在石缝中跳舞，在精神上绘制平面图并计划用黄铜和青铜进行装饰。
The Titania Imperial Museum stands as a celebration of all nations of Earth, but mostly Britain. It features exhibits ranging from the Empress' 'liberation of India from the state of non-British rule' to the 'shameful split of the Traitor Colonies' in the 18th Century.\n\nA few quickly shushed voices ponder whether there might be a degree of colonial bias to some of these exhibits. These whisperers are directed to the Curator, a proud royalist happy to ease their concerns by informing them that no, there is not.=泰坦尼亚帝国博物馆是对地球上所有国家的庆祝，但主要是英国。它的展品包括从皇后的'将印度从非英国统治的状态中解放出来'到18世纪'叛国殖民地的可耻分裂'。几个很快被掩盖的声音在思考这些展品中是否有某种程度的殖民主义偏见。这些窃窃私语的人被引向了馆长，一个骄傲的保皇党人很乐意通过告诉他们没有，来缓解他们的担忧。
The Titania Art Museum is already building a name for itself as one of Albion's greatest repositories of art, both real and modern. Any citizen can submit creations, and most of them have. Great halls are filled with statues in every material available, barely a wall lacks for a canvas whose paint has yet to completely dry.=泰坦尼亚艺术博物馆已经建立了自己的名声，成为阿尔比恩最伟大的艺术宝库之一，包括真实的和现代的。任何公民都可以提交创作，而且他们中的大多数都提交了。大厅里摆满了各种材料的雕像，几乎没有一面墙缺少颜料尚未完全干燥的画布。
The Great Library of Titania is mostly empty shelves, the original settlers having brought few books with them. With each new arrival, however, shelves begin filling with essential texts, including volumes QT of the Britannica, the almost complete works of Shakespeare, and a rare copy of the 1631 'Wicked Bible' containing the infamous misprint 'thou shalt commit adultery'.=泰坦尼亚的大图书馆大多是空架子，最初的定居者带来的书很少。然而，随着每个新移民的到来，书架上开始装满了基本的文本，包括《大英百科全书》的QT卷，几乎完整的莎士比亚作品，以及1631年'邪恶圣经'的罕见副本，其中包含臭名昭著的错字'你不得通奸'。

The Observatory is open. Scientists gather here to study the stars.=天文台已经开放。科学家们聚集在这里研究星星。

The Great Exhibition is open. Here the Benthic Enclave show off the latest Albion technologies.=大展览是开放的。在这里，Benthic Enclave 展示了最新的Albion技术。
In honour of the College, the Founders have given them an entire dome for their work. In awareness of how often said work has a tendency to go 'boom', it is the one furthest away from Valentine Square.=为了纪念学院，创始人给了他们一个完整的圆顶用于他们的工作。为了意识到上述工作有多大的'爆炸'倾向，它是离瓦伦丁广场最远的一个。
The telescope stretching from the Enclave is a thing of scientific beauty. With it, members can peer deep into not just the Reach, but Albion and Eleutheria. For some reason, turning it towards the Blue Kingdom has been less productive. A blackness takes over the glass; one not present when gazing with the naked eye.=从飞地延伸出来的望远镜是一种科学之美。有了它，成员们不仅可以窥探到Reach的深处，还可以看到Albion和Eleutheria。由于某些原因，把它转向蓝色王国的时候，就没有什么成果了。一种黑色的东西占据了玻璃；一种在用肉眼观察时不存在的东西。
The Benthic College Scientific Enclave is largely split into workshops where any experiment not likely to kill Titania's sprawling petals is permissible. The air around it echoes with the sound of small to moderate explosions, cursing, and the occasional wet splatter.=本瑟克学院的科学飞地基本上被分成了几个车间，在那里，任何不可能杀死泰坦尼亚无垠花瓣的实验都是被允许的。周围的空气中回荡着小到中度的爆炸声、咒骂声，以及偶尔的湿润飞溅。
The Great Exhibition takes up an entire dome, offering visitors a look at all the wonders of both London and the High Wilderness. Steam engines rumble and hoot. Stolen electrical devices from the Empyrean spray lightning into the atmosphere. Strange ambers of the Rubbery Men sit under spotlights, casting hypnotic colours as they slowly melt in the heat.=大展览占据了整个穹顶，为游客提供了伦敦和高等荒原的所有奇迹。蒸汽机隆隆作响，呼呼作响。从帝释天那里偷来的电气设备向大气中喷射闪电。橡皮人的奇异伏笔坐在聚光灯下，在高温下慢慢融化，投射出催眠般的色彩。
 Bombastic music from the Great Exhibition echoes through the streets.= 来自大展览的爆炸性音乐在街道上回荡。
 A series of explosions in the distance tell everyone that theEnclave students are hard at work.= 远处一连串的爆炸声告诉大家，飞地 的学生正在努力工作。
 People grind their teeth at the squeal of the Scientific Enclave's great telescope turning to face a new part of the sky.= 人们在科学飞地的大望远镜转向面对天空的新部分时发出的尖叫声中磨牙。

Work is slow on the new Salon, located just off Valentine Square. The Stone-Faced Sculptor waves away any questions or criticisms, determined only that whatever it turns out to be, it will be the finest example of it in the Reach.=新沙龙的工作进展缓慢，位于瓦伦丁广场附近。石脸雕塑家对任何问题或批评一笑置之，他只下定决心，无论结果如何，它都将是河内最好的例子。
The Erlking's Head is a poet's interpretation of a traditional Albion pub. From the outside, it looks like any other. Inside, there are soft chairs by a roaring fire that never goes out, the music is kept low so as not to interfere with discussions of importance, and everyone takes a numbered ticket for service instead of trying to get the bartender's attention.=厄尔京之首 是诗人对传统阿尔比恩酒馆的诠释。从外面看，它和其他地方一样。里面有柔软的椅子，旁边是永不熄灭的熊熊大火，音乐声很低，以免影响重要的讨论，每个人都拿着一张编号的票来接受服务，而不是试图引起酒保的注意。
Belphoebe's Salon is a quiet slice of civilisation where anyone can pass the time with a cup of tea, a slice of cake, and the glorious views over the petals and crystal domes. Approaches from the Murgatroyd Company to run the place on Titania's behalf have so far been met with little but hollow laughter.=贝尔霍贝的沙龙是一个安静的文明片区，任何人都可以在这里喝杯茶，吃块蛋糕，以及欣赏花瓣和水晶圆顶的辉煌景色来打发时间。穆尔加特罗伊德公司接洽代表泰坦尼亚经营这个地方，到目前为止，除了空洞的笑声外，几乎没有任何回应。
Puck's Corner is a small park where speech is free and unrestricted, though louder mouths should take care to remember that what they say isn't forgotten when they climb down from the literal soapbox. For the most part it is a place to tell stories rather than air grievances, with poets and comedians testing out new material free booing or ballistic tomatoes.=帕克角是一个小公园，这里的言论是自由的，不受限制的，尽管大嘴巴应该注意记住，当他们从字面上的肥皂盒上爬下来时，他们所说的话不会被遗忘。在大多数情况下，它是一个讲述故事而不是宣泄不满的地方，诗人和喜剧演员在这里测试新的材料，没有嘘声或球状的西红柿。
 The smell of fresh scones wafts over from the Salon.= 新鲜烤饼的味道从沙龙里飘来。
 Over in Puck's Corner, a new orator steps up to try their luck with the crowd.= 在帕克角，一个新的演说家站出来，在人群中试试他们的运气。
 A cheer rises from the pub, where every hour is happy.= 酒馆里响起了欢呼声，这里的每一个小时都是快乐的。

Her verses are progressing rather faster than the building work, due to representatives of the three great poetry schools being constantly at loggerheads over every little detail.=忧郁的诗人坐在花瓣的边缘，眺望布鲁姆-鲍尔，为新学院的建设谱写一首简短的十四行诗。她的诗句比建筑工程进展得更快，因为三大诗歌流派的代表在每一个小细节上不断争论不休。
The Svartlfar Academy is the new home  for the Nocturnal poetry school. Its architecture is dark and unwelcoming  light is  seemingly only invited in to better create shadows.

They refute all allegations that they are a cult supporting the Masters of Old London, but their cloaks and verse demonstrate a concerning nostalgia.=马南学院是巴扎林诗歌学校急需的新领域，现在他们的作品在阿尔比恩的大部分地区被禁止。他们驳斥了所有关于他们是支持旧伦敦大师的邪教的指控，但他们的斗篷和诗句表现出一种令人担忧的怀旧情绪。
The Elphame Academy is now home to the Mycologene school of poetry, its members easily recognised by the blemmigans on their heads and the confusion over which is the poet. Certainly, a blemmigan can write verses capable of touching even the harshest critic's soul, to say nothing of stab any who argue with their use of metaphor.=埃尔法姆学院现在是Mycologene诗歌流派的所在地，其成员很容易从他们头上的blemmigans和对谁是诗人的混淆中辨认出来。当然，blemmigan能写出的诗句甚至能触动最严厉的批评家的灵魂，更不用说刺伤任何争论他们使用隐喻的人。
 A cloaked figure watches the world go by from the shadows, occasionally scribbling notes.= 一个隐身的身影在阴影中看着这个世界的发展，不时地涂抹着笔记。
 A poet stands in the square, performing a depressing piece of their own creation.= 一位诗人站在广场上，表演他们自己创作的令人沮丧的作品。

Petal End was one of the hardest hit by the Chorister Bees, leaving its buildings little but firewood. Most of the detritus has been removed now, leaving just trees, rivers, and the water collected in its giant petal. The poets and sculptors wait impatiently for the Rhapsodic Mayor to finish skinny-dipping and offer some direction.=花瓣区是受乔里斯特蜜蜂袭击最严重的地区之一，它的建筑物除了柴火外几乎没有留下任何东西。现在大部分的残渣都被清除了，只剩下树木、河流和收集在其巨大花瓣中的水。诗人和雕塑家们不耐烦地等待着狂想曲市长完成裸泳并提供一些方向。
The fertile petal flesh of Titania has proven perfect for growing fruit. Giant strawberries glisten in the shafts of light pouring through the crystal domes above. Blueberries as big as fists hang from swollen bushes. In the trees, apples and oranges and pears hang like jewels, ready to be plucked the moment they ripen.=事实证明，泰坦尼亚肥沃的花瓣肉非常适合种植水果。巨大的草莓在通过水晶穹顶倾泻的光柱中闪闪发光。大如拳头的蓝莓挂在膨胀的灌木丛中。在树上，苹果、桔子和梨像珠宝一样挂着，准备在它们成熟的那一刻被摘下。

The architecture seems to have changed since you last walked here, but it's as jumbled and oppressive as ever.=英勇的改革者在你面前大步走过，大衣飘飘。沿着狭窄的楼梯，越过不稳定的桥梁，在摇摇欲坠的栏杆下。自从你上次走到这里，建筑似乎已经改变了，但它还是和以前一样杂乱无章，令人压抑。

The Reformer doesn't turn his head. He tells you that, in hope of escape, some of the prisoners change for the worse. Some crawl through the changing tunnels, warping their features and hollowing out the warm parts of their brains. In so doing they become monsters, further from redemption than ever.=改革者并没有转过头来。他告诉你，为了希望逃脱，一些囚犯变本加厉。有些人在变化的隧道中爬行，扭曲了他们的特征，掏空了他们大脑的温暖部分。这样一来，他们就变成了怪物，比以前更远离救赎。
The Deformer tells you not to worry - it's probably just one of the abominations he had a hand in creating. Maybe the thing with the many-jointed arms, or the leechboy. They're fine people, he insists, though they don't take too kindly to strangers in their territory.=变形者告诉你不要担心--这可能只是他参与创造的憎恶中的一个。也许是那个有很多关节的东西，或者水蛭男孩。他们是好人，他坚持说，尽管他们对在他们领土上的陌生人并不友好。
The Conformer doesn't turn her head. She tells you that, in hope of escape, some of the prisoners change into creatures of absurd size and hideous visage. They crawl through the changing tunnels, warping their features and hollowing out the warm parts of their brains, until they become monsters  but many were monsters to begin with, and so have still not changed enough to escape.=顺应者并没有转过头来。她告诉你，为了希望逃脱，一些囚犯变成了体型荒谬、面目狰狞的生物。他们在变化的隧道中爬行，扭曲他们的五官，掏空他们大脑的温暖部分，直到他们成为怪物，但许多人一开始就是怪物，所以仍然没有变化到足以逃脱。

unseen_queen_description=看不见的女王_描述
The Unseen Queen's throne-room is a ceaseless bustle of activity; servants attend her every whim, courtiers bombard her with anecdotes and wait in suspense for her laughter, stewards bring her petitions and scrolls. She waved them all away as soon as the herald announced your arrival, but they soon creep back around her.=看不见的女王的王室是一个无休止的喧嚣；仆人们满足她的每一个愿望，朝臣们用轶事轰炸她，并在悬念中等待她的笑声，管家们给她带来请愿和卷轴。传令官一宣布你的到来，她就把他们都挥散了，但他们很快又悄悄地回到她身边。
Amid the rubbish-heaps, space has been cleared for a throne of scrap metal and broken wood. Atop the throne sits a faded portrait. \n\nThe frame is silver-painted wood; it depicts a noblewoman sitting before an open window, hands folded neatly in her lap. Over her shoulder shines a crescent moon. The face has been furiously scratched out. \n\n\I would prefer you not see me like this,\ says the Unseen Queen mournfully. Her voice is melodious, ethereal, and comes from nowhere.=在垃圾堆中，已经为一个由废旧金属和碎木头组成的王座清理出了空间。宝座上坐着一张褪色的画像。\画框是银色的木头；它描绘了一个贵族妇女坐在一扇打开的窗户前，双手整齐地叠在膝上。她的肩膀上闪耀着一弯新月。她的脸被愤怒地划掉了。\我希望你不要看到我这个样子，看不见的女王哀伤地说道。她的声音悠扬、空灵，不知从何处传来。

When you ask, the rats cease to scurry and the flies no longer buzz. The Queen's portrait sits silently on her rusted throne.=当你问起，老鼠不再乱窜，苍蝇不再嗡嗡作响。女王的画像静静地坐在她生锈的宝座上。

dustyards_description=尘埃落定_描述
The Unseen Queen's castle is many leagues from your own, and you have ridden a great distance to get here. As you approach from a distance, you can see the castle sitting splendidly atop a mountain, silhouetted against the moon. Reaching it, however, is another matter entirely. \n\nThe path becomes too steep for your exhausted destrier; you will have to proceed on foot, if you can find a path at all through the thick gorse.=看不见的女王的城堡离你的城堡有很多里格，你骑马走了很远才到这里。当你从远处接近时，你可以看到城堡华丽地坐在山顶上，在月亮的映衬下显得格外耀眼。然而，要到达它，完全是另一回事。\这条路对你疲惫不堪的驯鹿来说太陡峭了；你将不得不徒步前进，如果你能在茂密的戈壁中找到一条路的话。
You descend to the deepest reaches of London, below even the shrouded slums. This dim realm is called Underlondon, and like most underthings, it is not mentioned in polite company. \n\nOnly the most desperate scavengers venture into Underlondon. Here, the city's rubbish collects in heaps the size of hills; the city's refuse falls like unpleasant, unrelenting rain.=你下到了伦敦的最深处，甚至在被笼罩的贫民窟下面。这个昏暗的领域被称为 伦敦地下，和大多数地下事物一样，它在礼貌的公司中不被提及。\只有最绝望的拾荒者才会冒险进入地下伦敦。在这里，城市的垃圾堆积如山；城市的垃圾像令人不快的、无情的雨一样落下。

didnt_find_queen=没有找到女王
You search for days, but the wooded mountain stubbornly refuses to yield up a path to the castle. After so much time wasted tramping back and forth, you sit on a tree-stump and wretchedly assess your situation.\n\nExcept... it's not a tree-stump. It's something which is dreadfully, dishearteningly squelchy. And you're no longer at the foot of a mountain, but at the foot of a mountain-size heap of rubbish. Where are you? How did you get here?=你找了好几天，但林立的山峰顽固地拒绝让出一条通往城堡的道路。在浪费了这么多时间来回跋涉之后，你坐在一个树桩上，可怜巴巴地评估你的处境。它是一种可怕的、令人沮丧的压抑的东西。你不再是在山脚下，而是在一个山一样大的垃圾堆的脚下。你在哪里？你是怎么到这里来的？
You search for days, clambering across mountain-sized heaps of abandoned, rusting metal. But you don't find anything that could be said to resemble a queen.=你找了好几天，爬过山一样大的废弃金属堆，生锈的金属。但你没有找到任何可以说是类似于女王的东西。
found_queen=发现女王
After a few hours of searching, the path reveals itself to you, opening up between the tangled trees with such a wonderful suddenness that you almost suspect magic at work. It doesn't take long to climb to the castle, where you call your name to the guard and wait as the drawbridge is lowered across a silver moat. \n\n\The Unseen Queen awaits you inside,\ says the guard. \You must have come far. Shall I order the servants to run a hot bath and fetch you a large dinner?\=经过几个小时的搜索，道路向你显露出来，在缠结的树木之间打开，其美妙的突然性让你几乎怀疑是魔法在起作用。没过多久，你就爬到了城堡，在那里你向守卫叫出了自己的名字，等待着吊桥被放下，横跨银色的护城河。\守卫说：看不见的女王在里面等着你，。\你一定是远道而来。要不要我命令仆人们给你洗个热水澡，给你拿个大餐？
After a few hours of searching, you come across a curious sight. \n\nA section of the rubbish-heap has been assiduously cleared and flattened. The pieces of rubbish that remain seem to have been carefully chosen for aesthetic reasons  piping, wire, scrap metal  and assembled into something approaching a throne. \n\nAnd sitting in the throne, a faded old portrait.=经过几个小时的搜索，你发现了一个奇怪的现象。\垃圾堆的一个部分已经被认真地清理和平整了。剩下的垃圾碎片似乎是出于审美的原因被精心挑选出来的，管道、铁丝、废金属，被组装成一个接近王座的东西。\坐在宝座上的是一幅褪色的旧画像。

The Queen's courtiers are exceedingly polite. Some are even reverential. \n\n\The quest for the Cup is the highest of callings,\ explains her seneschal earnestly, nibbling at a wedge of cheese. \We are always pleased to harbour another sworn knight in our household.\\n\nAfter a moment's consideration, he rummages in his pockets and retrieves the small, dripping corpse of some unidentifiable creature. It looks like a cross between worm and crab. \Here,\ he says. \This is all I can give you for now. I hope it helps on your quest.\\n\nYou thank him as fulsomely as you can, and try not to sound too taken aback.=女王的臣子们都非常有礼貌。有些人甚至很恭敬。\对圣杯的追求是最崇高的使命，她的参谋长认真地解释道，咬着一块奶酪的碎片。\在考虑了一会儿之后，他从口袋里翻出了一个小的、滴着水的、无法识别的生物的尸体。它看起来像虫子和螃蟹之间的交叉。\他说：在这里，他说。\这是我目前能给你的全部东西。我希望这对你的探索有帮助。你尽可能地感谢他，并尽量让自己听起来不那么吃惊。
As you kneel, the rodents form a semi-circle around you. One of them squeaks, runs a little way, then runs back and squeaks again.\n\nFinally you relent, and follow it between several mounds of rubbish. It stops beside the small corpse of some unidentifiable creature that looks like a cross between worm and crab.\n\nWhatever this is, you've never seen it anywhere else. It might be a monster unique to London's undercarriage. Probably best to take it back to the engine for study.=当你跪下时，啮齿动物在你周围形成一个半圆形。其中一只吱吱叫着，跑了一段路，然后又跑回来，又吱吱叫着。最后你忍不住了，跟着它走到几个垃圾堆之间。它停在一些无法辨认的生物的小尸体旁，看起来像是蠕虫和螃蟹的杂交体。不管这是什么，你在其他地方从未见过。它可能是伦敦底层特有的一种怪物。也许最好把它带回引擎进行研究。
duelling_the_quester=决斗_quester
Your foe is waiting atop the hill, sitting astride a destrier of his own. He is a knight in burnished armour, brandishing a sword with a red hilt and black blade. His latest conquest lies mangled at his feet: a demon with eyes of burning coal and flayed skin. As the knight turns his horse, it tramples the demon's corpse.\n\n\Have you come to challenge me for my sword?\ demands the knight, his eyes gleaming coldly. \Come, then. You may take it blade-first.\=你的敌人正在山顶上等待，坐在他自己的驯鹿上。他是一个身着光亮盔甲的骑士，挥舞着一把红色剑柄和黑色剑身的剑。他最新的征服者躺在他的脚下：一个眼睛像燃烧的煤炭，皮肤剥落的恶魔。当骑士转过马来时，马踩着恶魔的尸体。你是来挑战我的剑吗？骑士要求，他的眼睛闪着冷光。\那么，来吧。你可以先拿着它的刀。
A crowd is forming around you, the Chamberlain, and a moaning overseer. \Why the delay, blaggard?\ asks the Chamberlain, weaving his fountain pen back and forth like a sword. You grab his wrist, but he wriggles free. \Cheater! Fight me fair and square beneath the moonlight, coward!\ He turns on his heels and flees, darting down an alleyway.=一群人正围着你、张伯伦和一个呻吟的监督者。\张伯伦问道：为什么迟迟不来？他的钢笔像剑一样来回挥舞。你抓住他的手腕，但他挣脱了。\骗子！在月光下和我公平地战斗吧，懦夫！ 他转身就逃，在一条小巷里飞奔。

You hold up the tarnished nameplate torn from the hull of the Parzifal.=你举起从帕尔兹法尔号车体上撕下的污损铭牌。
You hold up the shining shield, and the walls of the court dance with reflected moonlight. The courtiers start to applaud; the Queen gracefully inclines her head.=你举起闪亮的盾牌，宫廷的墙壁在反射的月光下跳舞。朝臣们开始鼓掌；女王优雅地偏过头去。
You tell the Queen the tale of how you sat upon the Blindness Throne, and walked away with your eyesight intact. She listens raptly. The courtiers mutter admiringly among themselves. =你向女王讲述你如何坐在失明王座上，并带着你的视力离开的故事。她全神贯注地听着。臣子们彼此间钦佩地嘀咕着。

You unfurl the Cloak of the Lion, shimmering like gossamer. As the cloak ripples, the symbol of the lion seems to charge and pounce across the cloth. The courtiers raise an astounded cheer.=你展开狮子斗篷，像薄纱一样闪闪发光。当斗篷泛起涟漪时，狮子的标志似乎在布上冲锋陷阵，扑了个空。廷臣们发出了震惊的欢呼声。
You unfurl the dirty flag that you found entangled in a weather-vane.=你展开你发现缠绕在向风上的肮脏旗帜。

tournament_description=锦标赛_描述
The Grand Tournament stretches over countless acres of the Queen's gardens. The air is filled with song, laughter, the roaring of crowds; occasionally, the clash and clang of weaponry. Cooks are working tirelessly in the open air, roasting entire pigs on spits, mixing spices, baking crusty breads, and generally filling the air with a barrage of mouth-watering scents. \n\nThe happy atmosphere among the spectators belies the tension among the knights. Each quester is determined to triumph and take up the completed Minute to Midnight.=大比武延伸到女王的无数英亩的花园里。空气中充满了歌声、笑声和人群的轰鸣声；偶尔还有武器装备的碰撞声和叮当声。厨师们在户外不知疲倦地工作，在烤架上烤着整头猪，混合香料，烘烤脆皮面包，一般来说，空气中充满了一系列令人垂涎的香味。\观众们的快乐气氛掩盖了骑士们的紧张气氛。每个探索者都决心要取得胜利，拿下完成的《午夜前的一分钟》。
The Grand Tournament stretches over countless acres of mud and filth. The air is filled with sobbing, incoherent shouting, screams; occasionally, the rhythmic thud of fists hitting flesh.\n\nThere are hundreds of questers wandering back and forth in the desolation, some more lucid than others. Most are miserable specimens: bleary-eyed, shivering, wearing threadbare rags. You pass one on his hands and knees, furiously gnawing at a freshly-caught rat and complimenting a non-existent chef.=大竞技场绵延着无数亩的泥土和污秽。空气中充满了抽泣声、语无伦次的喊叫声和尖叫声；偶尔，还有拳头打在肉上的有节奏的砰砰声。有数百名探险者在荒凉中来回徘徊，有些人比其他人更清醒。大多数人都是悲惨的标本：眼冒金星，瑟瑟发抖，穿着破旧的衣服。你经过一个手脚并用的人时，他正疯狂地啃着一只刚抓到的老鼠，夸奖一个不存在的厨师。

Your rival jouster is riding a scarred destrier that looks as though it has something demonic in its ancestry. When you ride into the ring, your rival shoots you a sneer, then flips his visor shut. \n\nYour horses thunder toward each other at incredible, ground-shaking speed. Once, twice, three times you clash, and the spectators gasp as though they are witnessing the collision of two gods. Finally, on the fourth pass, you plant your lance squarely under the crook of his arm and lift him bodily from the saddle. \n\n\Victory!\ shouts the announcer, to the sound of bugles. \Glory to the new champion!\=你的对手骑着一只伤痕累累的Destrier，看起来好像它的祖先有什么恶魔一样。当你骑马上场时，你的对手向你投来一个冷笑，然后把他的面罩翻过来。\你们的马以惊人的、震撼人心的速度冲向对方。一次、两次、三次，你们发生了冲突，观众们喘着粗气，仿佛看到了两个神的碰撞。最后，在第四次冲突中，你把你的长矛正中他的臂弯，把他从马鞍上抬起来。\胜利！播音员在军号声中喊道。\Glory to the new champion!

Now you can see clearly, you realise that the melee is not filled with armoured knights. It is a sprawling collection of questers, most of them scrawny and dressed in tatters, battering each other with fists and sticks. The portrait of the Unseen Queen watches it all from atop a heightened throne.=现在你可以看清楚了，你意识到混战中的骑士并不是满身盔甲的。它是一个铺天盖地的追求者的集合，他们中的大多数人骨瘦如柴，衣衫褴褛，用拳头和棍棒互相敲打着。隐形女王的画像在高高的宝座上看着这一切。

\Thank you.\ The girl leads you to a backroom. The floor is stained; something storm-grey once puddled here. The child squeezes your hand,  then returns to her place on the stairs. \n\nIn the centre of the room is a table not much larger than a desk. Beside it is a gurney, with straps. An Austere Assistant, head to foot in black, stands beside it. She looks up as you enter. \Eat, if you are ready to begin.\=谢谢你。 女孩带你到一个密室。地板上有污渍；曾经有暴风雨般的灰色东西在这里堆积。孩子捏了捏你的手，然后回到了她在楼梯上的位置。\在房间的中央有一张比桌子大不了多少的桌子。旁边是一张轮床，有绑带。一个从头到脚都是黑色的奥斯丁助理站在旁边。当你进来时，她抬起头来。\吃吧，如果你准备好了就开始。

Once you feel up to standing.\ She gestures towards the back stair. \Take your time.

December=十二月
The dining table could seat twelve, but it is set for two. At the head is December. 'December' is not their real name, of course, but that name was not made to be spoken with tongue and lips and a throat.\n\nTheir face is long and serene, like a Borzoi hound, with the same soft nose, the anxious grin. Is that their mask, or their face? You do not recall them removing it to eat.=餐桌可以容纳12人，但它是为两人准备的。坐在首位的是十二月。十二月 当然不是他们的真名，但这个名字不是用舌头、嘴唇和喉咙说出来的。他们的脸长而宁静，就像一只波尔佐伊猎犬，有同样柔软的鼻子，焦急的笑容。那是他们的面具，还是他们的脸？你不记得他们摘下它来吃饭。
The table has been cleared of settings. December has propped a vast canvas against it, and is working. \n\nThey are too busy to converse, but you are welcome here.=桌子上的摆设已经被清理干净。十二月把一块巨大的帆布撑在上面，正在工作。\他们太忙了，无法交谈，但这里欢迎你。

The nearest land to the Xanthous Moon is the Moon's Sill. The path between it and the Empyrean main dock is well travelled by groups of small, privately-owned engines. Each convoy resembles a crowd of fireflies, drawn to the light of the Moon.\n\nThey travel here to perform rites of resolution and renewal, and to conduct the Mandate of the Moon.=离Xanthous月球最近的土地是月球之柱。在它和帝都主码头之间的道路上，有很多小型的、私人拥有的发动机群在行驶。每个车队都像一群萤火虫，被月亮的光辉所吸引。他们在这里旅行，举行解决和更新的仪式，并进行月亮的任务。
The Empyreals crowd the hill's flanks. No one stands at the top. That privilege will be for the engineers: those brave souls who are to travel to the Xanthous Moon. \n\nThey will live on the gantries of the Moon for the next fortnight, performing essential repairs and maintenance. Doing so will earn them the enmity of the things that live in the dark. They cannot return till the time of the next rite.=帝王们挤满了山丘的侧翼。没有人站在山顶。那是工程师们的特权：那些将前往桑塔斯月球的勇敢的灵魂。\在接下来的两个星期里，他们将住在月球的门架上，进行必要的修理和维护。这样做会使他们遭到生活在黑暗中的事物的敌视。他们不能返回，直到下一次祭祀的时候。
The Eagle Khan's daughter arrives in a small, heavily armoured engine. Her guards ensure the crowd is at a respectful distance before she disembarks. Her robes are azure blue, and decorated with threads of gold. Her hat bristles with eagles' feathers.\n\nThe crowd parts before her. She leads the way to the edge of a small lake  the Moon's Mirror.=鹰身人汗的女儿乘坐一辆小型的重装甲发动机抵达。她的卫兵在她下船之前，确保人群与她保持一个恭敬的距离。她的长袍是天蓝色的，上面装饰着金线。她的帽子上长满了鹰的羽毛。人群在她面前分开。她带领大家走到一个小湖的边缘，即月亮之镜。
The ceremony is complete. It is time for the citizens of the Eagle's Empyrean to return to their daily lives. =仪式已经完成。现在是鹰之帝国的公民返回他们日常生活的时候了。
The engineers have landed. They stand outside the circle of Empyreals, their clothes in tatters, smeared with oil and dirt. But they are safe, and they are sound. All around you, lanterns are lit; a warm glow grows and brightens. \n\nThe crowd parts; the engineers climb up through it to the centre.=工程师们已经着陆了。他们站在帝王圈外，他们的衣服破烂不堪，沾满了油污和灰尘。但他们是安全的，他们是健全的。在你的周围，灯笼被点燃了；一股温暖的光芒在增长和变亮。\人群分开了；工程师们通过它爬上了中心。

The Empyreals light only enough lamps to pick their way to the site of the ceremony. Occasionally, there is a muffled curse as someone stumbles and falls. The Empyreals gather in a large crater, huddled together, waiting. \n\nIt is time for the Rite of Resolution.=帝王们只点了足够的灯，以挑选他们前往仪式地点的道路。偶尔，当有人跌倒时，会传来一声低沉的咒语。帝王们聚集在一个大坑里，蜷缩在一起，等待着。\It is time for the Rite of Resolution.。
